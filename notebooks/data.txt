As part of my internship at the Limburg investment company, LRM NV, I had the opportunity to attend the 4th SHOW Pan-European Workshop in Düsseldorf yesterday. The workshop consisted of a demo visit in Monheim, where autonomous shuttles are being deployed to enhance the existing public transport services.

Two speaking sessions took place in the afternoon. One covered successful stories about autonomous vehicles and public transport, the other was about building ecosystems. It was instructive to listen to the insights of the speakers and other SHOW project participants.

Thank you to my internship supervisor at LRM, , for this opportunity!

The state of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles are here!

Cedric Dupont Senior director product management Google Waymo sharing his learnings and current state of the industry.

Biggest lesson learned: Even our colleague testers can’t distinguish between “half ready and fully ready”
-> so we decided to go all in.


Other highlights:
2015 fully driving, remember the cute waymo car? (In the pictures!)

Luckily robots at other drivers 😅

24/7 autonomous driving, especially during the day is due to bicycles. 🚲

Elderly inclusivity as dependency to a driver is a hurdle! 👴

Collaboration with , shows we’re doing great as robots, not as humans, and robots are improving 🤭


Stay tuned to further waymo updates soon! Some shuttles in Sweden?

Hiermee willen we de opkomst van autonoom vervoer in Vlaanderen in goede banen leiden en nieuwe pilootprojecten maximaal ondersteunen. Autonoom vervoer biedt economische kansen, maar evengoed ook kansen op vlak van rijkwaliteit en verkeersveiligheid. 🌱🛣️

The state of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles are here!

Cedric Dupont Senior director product management Google Waymo sharing his learnings and current state of the industry.

Biggest lesson learned: Even our colleague testers can’t distinguish between “half ready and fully ready”
-> so we decided to go all in.


Other highlights:
2015 fully driving, remember the cute waymo car? (In the pictures!)

Luckily robots at other drivers 😅

24/7 autonomous driving, especially during the day is due to bicycles. 🚲

Elderly inclusivity as dependency to a driver is a hurdle! 👴

Collaboration with , shows we’re doing great as robots, not as humans, and robots are improving 🤭


Stay tuned to further waymo updates soon! Some shuttles in Sweden?

As part of my internship at the Limburg investment company, LRM NV, I had the opportunity to attend the 4th SHOW Pan-European Workshop in Düsseldorf yesterday. The workshop consisted of a demo visit in Monheim, where autonomous shuttles are being deployed to enhance the existing public transport services.

Two speaking sessions took place in the afternoon. One covered successful stories about autonomous vehicles and public transport, the other was about building ecosystems. It was instructive to listen to the insights of the speakers and other SHOW project participants.

Thank you to my internship supervisor at LRM, , for this opportunity!

Yesterday, I had the opportunity to assist Tim Paridaens at the ITS.be 2023 congress for an interesting knowledge-sharing session. We delved deep into the impacts of 5G and AI on mobility ecosystems, exploring the substantial value they bring. 🚗 👌

During this session, we seized the moment to share our invaluable insights from and our vision on how to harness the power of 5G and AI to address current mobility challenges and pave the way for the deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles. It was truly enriching to engage with prominent mobility stakeholders like , , , @Digital Flanders, and . 😎

The day also afforded me the privilege of attending various presentations on electromobility innovations and an engaging CEO debate. The key take-away from all these sessions: driving mobility innovations necessitates a harmonious partnership between public and private stakeholders. This collaboration is essential to establish regulations that facilitate the integration of new technologies and empower companies to cultivate sustainable business models. 🙏 🤝

Last but no least, our solutions must be inherently user-centric, providing a seamless and satisfying experience that encourages people to adopt gentler and more sustainable modes of transportation. 🛴 🚲 🚕 🚆 🚌

I'm truly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us to shape the future of mobility !

As part of my internship at the Limburg investment company, LRM NV, I had the opportunity to attend the 4th SHOW Pan-European Workshop in Düsseldorf yesterday. The workshop consisted of a demo visit in Monheim, where autonomous shuttles are being deployed to enhance the existing public transport services.

Two speaking sessions took place in the afternoon. One covered successful stories about autonomous vehicles and public transport, the other was about building ecosystems. It was instructive to listen to the insights of the speakers and other SHOW project participants.

Thank you to my internship supervisor at LRM, , for this opportunity!

During this session, we seized the moment to share our invaluable insights from and our vision on how to harness the power of 5G and AI to address current mobility challenges and pave the way for the deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles. It was truly enriching to engage with prominent mobility stakeholders like , , , @Digital Flanders, and . 😎

The day also afforded me the privilege of attending various presentations on electromobility innovations and an engaging CEO debate. The key take-away from all these sessions: driving mobility innovations necessitates a harmonious partnership between public and private stakeholders. This collaboration is essential to establish regulations that facilitate the integration of new technologies and empower companies to cultivate sustainable business models. 🙏 🤝

Last but no least, our solutions must be inherently user-centric, providing a seamless and satisfying experience that encourages people to adopt gentler and more sustainable modes of transportation. 🛴 🚲 🚕 🚆 🚌

As part of my internship at the Limburg investment company, LRM NV, I had the opportunity to attend the 4th SHOW Pan-European Workshop in Düsseldorf yesterday. The workshop consisted of a demo visit in Monheim, where autonomous shuttles are being deployed to enhance the existing public transport services.

Two speaking sessions took place in the afternoon. One covered successful stories about autonomous vehicles and public transport, the other was about building ecosystems. It was instructive to listen to the insights of the speakers and other SHOW project participants.

Thank you to my internship supervisor at LRM, , for this opportunity!

The state of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles are here!

Cedric Dupont Senior director product management Google Waymo sharing his learnings and current state of the industry.

Biggest lesson learned: Even our colleague testers can’t distinguish between “half ready and fully ready”
-> so we decided to go all in.


Other highlights:
2015 fully driving, remember the cute waymo car? (In the pictures!)

Luckily robots at other drivers 😅

24/7 autonomous driving, especially during the day is due to bicycles. 🚲

Elderly inclusivity as dependency to a driver is a hurdle! 👴

Collaboration with , shows we’re doing great as robots, not as humans, and robots are improving 🤭


Stay tuned to further waymo updates soon! Some shuttles in Sweden?

The day also afforded me the privilege of attending various presentations on electromobility innovations and an engaging CEO debate. The key take-away from all these sessions: driving mobility innovations necessitates a harmonious partnership between public and private stakeholders. This collaboration is essential to establish regulations that facilitate the integration of new technologies and empower companies to cultivate sustainable business models. 🙏 🤝

Last but no least, our solutions must be inherently user-centric, providing a seamless and satisfying experience that encourages people to adopt gentler and more sustainable modes of transportation. 🛴 🚲 🚕 🚆 🚌

I'm truly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us to shape the future of mobility !

As part of my internship at the Limburg investment company, LRM NV, I had the opportunity to attend the 4th SHOW Pan-European Workshop in Düsseldorf yesterday. The workshop consisted of a demo visit in Monheim, where autonomous shuttles are being deployed to enhance the existing public transport services.

Two speaking sessions took place in the afternoon. One covered successful stories about autonomous vehicles and public transport, the other was about building ecosystems. It was instructive to listen to the insights of the speakers and other SHOW project participants.

Thank you to my internship supervisor at LRM, , for this opportunity!

As part of my internship at the Limburg investment company, LRM NV, I had the opportunity to attend the 4th SHOW Pan-European Workshop in Düsseldorf yesterday. The workshop consisted of a demo visit in Monheim, where autonomous shuttles are being deployed to enhance the existing public transport services.

Two speaking sessions took place in the afternoon. One covered successful stories about autonomous vehicles and public transport, the other was about building ecosystems. It was instructive to listen to the insights of the speakers and other SHOW project participants.

Thank you to my internship supervisor at LRM, , for this opportunity!

The state of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles are here!

Cedric Dupont Senior director product management Google Waymo sharing his learnings and current state of the industry.

Biggest lesson learned: Even our colleague testers can’t distinguish between “half ready and fully ready”
-> so we decided to go all in.


Other highlights:
2015 fully driving, remember the cute waymo car? (In the pictures!)

Luckily robots at other drivers 😅

24/7 autonomous driving, especially during the day is due to bicycles. 🚲

Elderly inclusivity as dependency to a driver is a hurdle! 👴

Collaboration with , shows we’re doing great as robots, not as humans, and robots are improving 🤭


Stay tuned to further waymo updates soon! Some shuttles in Sweden?

Yesterday, I had the opportunity to assist Tim Paridaens at the ITS.be 2023 congress for an interesting knowledge-sharing session. We delved deep into the impacts of 5G and AI on mobility ecosystems, exploring the substantial value they bring. 🚗 👌

During this session, we seized the moment to share our invaluable insights from and our vision on how to harness the power of 5G and AI to address current mobility challenges and pave the way for the deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles. It was truly enriching to engage with prominent mobility stakeholders like , , , @Digital Flanders, and . 😎

The day also afforded me the privilege of attending various presentations on electromobility innovations and an engaging CEO debate. The key take-away from all these sessions: driving mobility innovations necessitates a harmonious partnership between public and private stakeholders. This collaboration is essential to establish regulations that facilitate the integration of new technologies and empower companies to cultivate sustainable business models. 🙏 🤝

Last but no least, our solutions must be inherently user-centric, providing a seamless and satisfying experience that encourages people to adopt gentler and more sustainable modes of transportation. 🛴 🚲 🚕 🚆 🚌

I'm truly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us to shape the future of mobility !

As part of my internship at the Limburg investment company, LRM NV, I had the opportunity to attend the 4th SHOW Pan-European Workshop in Düsseldorf yesterday. The workshop consisted of a demo visit in Monheim, where autonomous shuttles are being deployed to enhance the existing public transport services.

Two speaking sessions took place in the afternoon. One covered successful stories about autonomous vehicles and public transport, the other was about building ecosystems. It was instructive to listen to the insights of the speakers and other SHOW project participants.

Thank you to my internship supervisor at LRM, , for this opportunity!

As part of my internship at the Limburg investment company, LRM NV, I had the opportunity to attend the 4th SHOW Pan-European Workshop in Düsseldorf yesterday. The workshop consisted of a demo visit in Monheim, where autonomous shuttles are being deployed to enhance the existing public transport services.

Two speaking sessions took place in the afternoon. One covered successful stories about autonomous vehicles and public transport, the other was about building ecosystems. It was instructive to listen to the insights of the speakers and other SHOW project participants.

Thank you to my internship supervisor at LRM, , for this opportunity!

The state of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles are here!

Cedric Dupont Senior director product management Google Waymo sharing his learnings and current state of the industry.

Biggest lesson learned: Even our colleague testers can’t distinguish between “half ready and fully ready”
-> so we decided to go all in.


Other highlights:
2015 fully driving, remember the cute waymo car? (In the pictures!)

Luckily robots at other drivers 😅

24/7 autonomous driving, especially during the day is due to bicycles. 🚲

Elderly inclusivity as dependency to a driver is a hurdle! 👴

Collaboration with , shows we’re doing great as robots, not as humans, and robots are improving 🤭


Stay tuned to further waymo updates soon! Some shuttles in Sweden?

Yesterday, I had the opportunity to assist Tim Paridaens at the ITS.be 2023 congress for an interesting knowledge-sharing session. We delved deep into the impacts of 5G and AI on mobility ecosystems, exploring the substantial value they bring. 🚗 👌

During this session, we seized the moment to share our invaluable insights from and our vision on how to harness the power of 5G and AI to address current mobility challenges and pave the way for the deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles. It was truly enriching to engage with prominent mobility stakeholders like , , , @Digital Flanders, and . 😎

The day also afforded me the privilege of attending various presentations on electromobility innovations and an engaging CEO debate. The key take-away from all these sessions: driving mobility innovations necessitates a harmonious partnership between public and private stakeholders. This collaboration is essential to establish regulations that facilitate the integration of new technologies and empower companies to cultivate sustainable business models. 🙏 🤝

Last but no least, our solutions must be inherently user-centric, providing a seamless and satisfying experience that encourages people to adopt gentler and more sustainable modes of transportation. 🛴 🚲 🚕 🚆 🚌

I'm truly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us to shape the future of mobility !

As part of my internship at the Limburg investment company, LRM NV, I had the opportunity to attend the 4th SHOW Pan-European Workshop in Düsseldorf yesterday. The workshop consisted of a demo visit in Monheim, where autonomous shuttles are being deployed to enhance the existing public transport services.

Two speaking sessions took place in the afternoon. One covered successful stories about autonomous vehicles and public transport, the other was about building ecosystems. It was instructive to listen to the insights of the speakers and other SHOW project participants.

Thank you to my internship supervisor at LRM, , for this opportunity!

As part of my internship at the Limburg investment company, LRM NV, I had the opportunity to attend the 4th SHOW Pan-European Workshop in Düsseldorf yesterday. The workshop consisted of a demo visit in Monheim, where autonomous shuttles are being deployed to enhance the existing public transport services.

Two speaking sessions took place in the afternoon. One covered successful stories about autonomous vehicles and public transport, the other was about building ecosystems. It was instructive to listen to the insights of the speakers and other SHOW project participants.

Thank you to my internship supervisor at LRM, , for this opportunity!

The state of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles are here!

Cedric Dupont Senior director product management Google Waymo sharing his learnings and current state of the industry.

Biggest lesson learned: Even our colleague testers can’t distinguish between “half ready and fully ready”
-> so we decided to go all in.


Other highlights:
2015 fully driving, remember the cute waymo car? (In the pictures!)

Luckily robots at other drivers 😅

24/7 autonomous driving, especially during the day is due to bicycles. 🚲

Elderly inclusivity as dependency to a driver is a hurdle! 👴

Collaboration with , shows we’re doing great as robots, not as humans, and robots are improving 🤭


Stay tuned to further waymo updates soon! Some shuttles in Sweden?

Yesterday, I had the opportunity to assist Tim Paridaens at the ITS.be 2023 congress for an interesting knowledge-sharing session. We delved deep into the impacts of 5G and AI on mobility ecosystems, exploring the substantial value they bring. 🚗 👌

During this session, we seized the moment to share our invaluable insights from and our vision on how to harness the power of 5G and AI to address current mobility challenges and pave the way for the deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles. It was truly enriching to engage with prominent mobility stakeholders like , , , @Digital Flanders, and . 😎

The day also afforded me the privilege of attending various presentations on electromobility innovations and an engaging CEO debate. The key take-away from all these sessions: driving mobility innovations necessitates a harmonious partnership between public and private stakeholders. This collaboration is essential to establish regulations that facilitate the integration of new technologies and empower companies to cultivate sustainable business models. 🙏 🤝

Last but no least, our solutions must be inherently user-centric, providing a seamless and satisfying experience that encourages people to adopt gentler and more sustainable modes of transportation. 🛴 🚲 🚕 🚆 🚌

I'm truly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us to shape the future of mobility !

As part of my internship at the Limburg investment company, LRM NV, I had the opportunity to attend the 4th SHOW Pan-European Workshop in Düsseldorf yesterday. The workshop consisted of a demo visit in Monheim, where autonomous shuttles are being deployed to enhance the existing public transport services.

Two speaking sessions took place in the afternoon. One covered successful stories about autonomous vehicles and public transport, the other was about building ecosystems. It was instructive to listen to the insights of the speakers and other SHOW project participants.

Thank you to my internship supervisor at LRM, , for this opportunity!

As part of my internship at the Limburg investment company, LRM NV, I had the opportunity to attend the 4th SHOW Pan-European Workshop in Düsseldorf yesterday. The workshop consisted of a demo visit in Monheim, where autonomous shuttles are being deployed to enhance the existing public transport services.

Two speaking sessions took place in the afternoon. One covered successful stories about autonomous vehicles and public transport, the other was about building ecosystems. It was instructive to listen to the insights of the speakers and other SHOW project participants.

Thank you to my internship supervisor at LRM, , for this opportunity!

The state of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles are here!

Cedric Dupont Senior director product management Google Waymo sharing his learnings and current state of the industry.

Biggest lesson learned: Even our colleague testers can’t distinguish between “half ready and fully ready”
-> so we decided to go all in.


Other highlights:
2015 fully driving, remember the cute waymo car? (In the pictures!)

Luckily robots at other drivers 😅

24/7 autonomous driving, especially during the day is due to bicycles. 🚲

Elderly inclusivity as dependency to a driver is a hurdle! 👴

Collaboration with , shows we’re doing great as robots, not as humans, and robots are improving 🤭


Stay tuned to further waymo updates soon! Some shuttles in Sweden?

Yesterday, I had the opportunity to assist Tim Paridaens at the ITS.be 2023 congress for an interesting knowledge-sharing session. We delved deep into the impacts of 5G and AI on mobility ecosystems, exploring the substantial value they bring. 🚗 👌

During this session, we seized the moment to share our invaluable insights from and our vision on how to harness the power of 5G and AI to address current mobility challenges and pave the way for the deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles. It was truly enriching to engage with prominent mobility stakeholders like , , , @Digital Flanders, and . 😎

The day also afforded me the privilege of attending various presentations on electromobility innovations and an engaging CEO debate. The key take-away from all these sessions: driving mobility innovations necessitates a harmonious partnership between public and private stakeholders. This collaboration is essential to establish regulations that facilitate the integration of new technologies and empower companies to cultivate sustainable business models. 🙏 🤝

Last but no least, our solutions must be inherently user-centric, providing a seamless and satisfying experience that encourages people to adopt gentler and more sustainable modes of transportation. 🛴 🚲 🚕 🚆 🚌

I'm truly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us to shape the future of mobility !

Autonomous Vehicles Market Growth & Trends
 
The global autonomous vehicle market size was exhibited at USD 131.75 billion in 2022 and is projected to hit around USD 3,521.78 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 38.9% during the forecast period 2023 to 2032. An autonomous vehicle is a combination of various networking systems and sensors that assist the computer in driving the vehicle. The significant advancements in technology, such as sensor processing, adaptive algorithms, high processing maps, and enhanced AI, have contributed to companies increasing their production capacity and taking the autonomous vehicle market to the next level.

Several technology providers such as Google LLC and Tesla Motors have also entered the market and have contributed toward the research and development of autonomous vehicles. The automobile industry is dynamic and changes with advancements in technologies. Several major players in the industry, such as General Motors Company, Volkswagen AG, Mercedes-Benz, BMW AG, and others, invest a significant part of their revenue toward researching and developing technologies.

Currently, there is a growing trend of autonomous vehicles in the automotive industry, thus attracting larger investments in developing these vehicles. Also, governments in the U.K have granted permission to test autonomous cars on public roads. Furthermore, Switzerland's Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy, and Communications has permitted driverless testing on Zurich streets. Governments of different nations have taken the initiative to promote autonomous vehicles.

For instance, in January 2021, the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) released its comprehensive plan for automated vehicles. This is initiated to advance the department's work, prioritizing safety and preparing for a smooth transportation system for autonomous vehicles. The initiative also promotes collaboration and transparency in the Automated Driving Systems (ADS).

The market has been segmented, based on application, into transportation and defense. The transportation segment is expected to have a higher market share; however, the defense segment is expected to portray the highest growth during the projection period. The North American region accounted for the largest share of the market in 2021. The demand for autonomous vehicles is expected to increase during the forecast period, in line with rising government regulations and increased acceptance of self-driving vehicles in the U.S.

As part of my internship at the Limburg investment company, LRM NV, I had the opportunity to attend the 4th SHOW Pan-European Workshop in Düsseldorf yesterday. The workshop consisted of a demo visit in Monheim, where autonomous shuttles are being deployed to enhance the existing public transport services.

Two speaking sessions took place in the afternoon. One covered successful stories about autonomous vehicles and public transport, the other was about building ecosystems. It was instructive to listen to the insights of the speakers and other SHOW project participants.

Thank you to my internship supervisor at LRM, , for this opportunity!

The state of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles are here!

Cedric Dupont Senior director product management Google Waymo sharing his learnings and current state of the industry.

Biggest lesson learned: Even our colleague testers can’t distinguish between “half ready and fully ready”
-> so we decided to go all in.


Other highlights:
2015 fully driving, remember the cute waymo car? (In the pictures!)

Luckily robots at other drivers 😅

24/7 autonomous driving, especially during the day is due to bicycles. 🚲

Elderly inclusivity as dependency to a driver is a hurdle! 👴

Collaboration with , shows we’re doing great as robots, not as humans, and robots are improving 🤭


Stay tuned to further waymo updates soon! Some shuttles in Sweden?

Yesterday, I had the opportunity to assist Tim Paridaens at the ITS.be 2023 congress for an interesting knowledge-sharing session. We delved deep into the impacts of 5G and AI on mobility ecosystems, exploring the substantial value they bring. 🚗 👌

During this session, we seized the moment to share our invaluable insights from and our vision on how to harness the power of 5G and AI to address current mobility challenges and pave the way for the deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles. It was truly enriching to engage with prominent mobility stakeholders like , , , @Digital Flanders, and . 😎

The day also afforded me the privilege of attending various presentations on electromobility innovations and an engaging CEO debate. The key take-away from all these sessions: driving mobility innovations necessitates a harmonious partnership between public and private stakeholders. This collaboration is essential to establish regulations that facilitate the integration of new technologies and empower companies to cultivate sustainable business models. 🙏 🤝

Last but no least, our solutions must be inherently user-centric, providing a seamless and satisfying experience that encourages people to adopt gentler and more sustainable modes of transportation. 🛴 🚲 🚕 🚆 🚌

I'm truly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us to shape the future of mobility !

As part of my internship at the Limburg investment company, LRM NV, I had the opportunity to attend the 4th SHOW Pan-European Workshop in Düsseldorf yesterday. The workshop consisted of a demo visit in Monheim, where autonomous shuttles are being deployed to enhance the existing public transport services.

Two speaking sessions took place in the afternoon. One covered successful stories about autonomous vehicles and public transport, the other was about building ecosystems. It was instructive to listen to the insights of the speakers and other SHOW project participants.

Thank you to my internship supervisor at LRM, , for this opportunity!

As part of my internship at the Limburg investment company, LRM NV, I had the opportunity to attend the 4th SHOW Pan-European Workshop in Düsseldorf yesterday. The workshop consisted of a demo visit in Monheim, where autonomous shuttles are being deployed to enhance the existing public transport services.

Two speaking sessions took place in the afternoon. One covered successful stories about autonomous vehicles and public transport, the other was about building ecosystems. It was instructive to listen to the insights of the speakers and other SHOW project participants.

Thank you to my internship supervisor at LRM, , for this opportunity!

The state of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles are here!

Cedric Dupont Senior director product management Google Waymo sharing his learnings and current state of the industry.

Biggest lesson learned: Even our colleague testers can’t distinguish between “half ready and fully ready”
-> so we decided to go all in.


Other highlights:
2015 fully driving, remember the cute waymo car? (In the pictures!)

Luckily robots at other drivers 😅

24/7 autonomous driving, especially during the day is due to bicycles. 🚲

Elderly inclusivity as dependency to a driver is a hurdle! 👴

Collaboration with , shows we’re doing great as robots, not as humans, and robots are improving 🤭


Stay tuned to further waymo updates soon! Some shuttles in Sweden?

Yesterday, I had the opportunity to assist Tim Paridaens at the ITS.be 2023 congress for an interesting knowledge-sharing session. We delved deep into the impacts of 5G and AI on mobility ecosystems, exploring the substantial value they bring. 🚗 👌

During this session, we seized the moment to share our invaluable insights from and our vision on how to harness the power of 5G and AI to address current mobility challenges and pave the way for the deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles. It was truly enriching to engage with prominent mobility stakeholders like , , , @Digital Flanders, and . 😎

The day also afforded me the privilege of attending various presentations on electromobility innovations and an engaging CEO debate. The key take-away from all these sessions: driving mobility innovations necessitates a harmonious partnership between public and private stakeholders. This collaboration is essential to establish regulations that facilitate the integration of new technologies and empower companies to cultivate sustainable business models. 🙏 🤝

Last but no least, our solutions must be inherently user-centric, providing a seamless and satisfying experience that encourages people to adopt gentler and more sustainable modes of transportation. 🛴 🚲 🚕 🚆 🚌

I'm truly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us to shape the future of mobility !

Autonomous Vehicles Market Growth & Trends
 
The global autonomous vehicle market size was exhibited at USD 131.75 billion in 2022 and is projected to hit around USD 3,521.78 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 38.9% during the forecast period 2023 to 2032. An autonomous vehicle is a combination of various networking systems and sensors that assist the computer in driving the vehicle. The significant advancements in technology, such as sensor processing, adaptive algorithms, high processing maps, and enhanced AI, have contributed to companies increasing their production capacity and taking the autonomous vehicle market to the next level.

Several technology providers such as Google LLC and Tesla Motors have also entered the market and have contributed toward the research and development of autonomous vehicles. The automobile industry is dynamic and changes with advancements in technologies. Several major players in the industry, such as General Motors Company, Volkswagen AG, Mercedes-Benz, BMW AG, and others, invest a significant part of their revenue toward researching and developing technologies.

Currently, there is a growing trend of autonomous vehicles in the automotive industry, thus attracting larger investments in developing these vehicles. Also, governments in the U.K have granted permission to test autonomous cars on public roads. Furthermore, Switzerland's Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy, and Communications has permitted driverless testing on Zurich streets. Governments of different nations have taken the initiative to promote autonomous vehicles.

For instance, in January 2021, the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) released its comprehensive plan for automated vehicles. This is initiated to advance the department's work, prioritizing safety and preparing for a smooth transportation system for autonomous vehicles. The initiative also promotes collaboration and transparency in the Automated Driving Systems (ADS).

The market has been segmented, based on application, into transportation and defense. The transportation segment is expected to have a higher market share; however, the defense segment is expected to portray the highest growth during the projection period. The North American region accounted for the largest share of the market in 2021. The demand for autonomous vehicles is expected to increase during the forecast period, in line with rising government regulations and increased acceptance of self-driving vehicles in the U.S.

As part of my internship at the Limburg investment company, LRM NV, I had the opportunity to attend the 4th SHOW Pan-European Workshop in Düsseldorf yesterday. The workshop consisted of a demo visit in Monheim, where autonomous shuttles are being deployed to enhance the existing public transport services.

Two speaking sessions took place in the afternoon. One covered successful stories about autonomous vehicles and public transport, the other was about building ecosystems. It was instructive to listen to the insights of the speakers and other SHOW project participants.

Thank you to my internship supervisor at LRM, , for this opportunity!
