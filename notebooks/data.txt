As part of my internship at the Limburg investment company, LRM NV, I had the opportunity to attend the 4th SHOW Pan-European Workshop in Düsseldorf yesterday. The workshop consisted of a demo visit in Monheim, where autonomous shuttles are being deployed to enhance the existing public transport services.Two speaking sessions took place in the afternoon. One covered successful stories about autonomous vehicles and public transport, the other was about building ecosystems. It was instructive to listen to the insights of the speakers and other SHOW project participants.Thank you to my internship supervisor at LRM, , for this opportunity!
