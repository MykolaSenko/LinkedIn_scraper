After many years of development and (restricted) testing, and not more than 10 days ago, California regulators have given the green light to Cruise (General Motors) and Waymo (Google) to offer commercial robotaxi services 24 hours a day, seven days a week, across the city. Impressed to see that these operators are now ready to shift from testing and piloting to commercially scaling their technologies. The enormous investments of AV start-ups are clearly visible in the San Francisco streets. We were extremely lucky to see and experience ourselves these disruptive ride-hailing services, without a safety driver inside the vehicle. I was really impressed by the level of comfort and safety in all circumstances (day, night, traffic jams, complex traffic situations, …). Yes, autonomous vehicles are coming. I am convinced that this technology will sooner than later disrupt our urban mobility making it much more safe, efficient, user friendly, environment friendly and affordable for everyone. We had meetings with several government regulators giving us an insight on the complex permit journey and the challenges they still see. It was quite surprising to see how the relatively few AV collisions were making daily the news in San Francisco, while the safety potential is so high compared to human drivers. In our meetings with several government regulators, we received a much better understanding in both underregulating and overregulation AV innovation. The real success of this study trip was bringing together several Belgian stakeholders including federal and regional authorities and public transport operators to see, feel and experience AV. Also in Belgium, structured dialogues with public and private stakeholders will be key to introduce the next level of AV in our country, understanding the positive impact of AV but also to anticipate on unwanted effects like the substitution of public transport or an unwanted uptake of vehicle-kms. The real success of this study trip was by bringing together many Belgian stakeholders active in the mobility ecosystem exploring and experiencing the potential of AV and reflecting on next steps in Belgium.

Nondeterministic models require a comparative memory of correctness in order to sort out correct/incorrect and safe/unsafe newly made relationships. They also need to know that the vehicle can fit between and pass and stop at a safe distance. The HARA, as approached by 7FM will provide a useful comparative memory for such use as well a better lesson plan. Driving and figuring out why a human steers and brakes avoids the need to figure out how to write the code. It produces an erratic driver that does not know safe from unsafe. Self-learning models only learn AFTER a crash, or it is observed performing a wrong decision. This is the make-test-fix design process, and it will NEVER produce a safe design.Autonomy can perform correct/incorrect throttle, braking, and steering. Safety means that autonomy knows WHY the commands are safe.This is the evidence required to ship autonomy to an OEM truck/vehicle manufacturer.', \"Discover the Unseen Tech Transformation : Secrets Behind DARPA's Impact in our Life#DARPA #Innovation #Technology #Impact #FutureTech\", '🚨Welcome to the #AustinNext Newsletter🚨🎙️An #Austin superpower is \"We are Living in the Future,\" which means we create & deploy locally.

Nomophobia (NO MObile PHone PhoBIA) describes the psychological condition when people fear being detached from mobile phone connectivity. This can include the fear of an empty battery. With the proliferation of electric vehicles, we see a similar phenomenon known as range anxiety.Range Anxiety is the fear that an electric vehicle will not have enough battery to reach its destination. I experienced range anxiety recently when I drove to a remote destination hotel in rural Ireland. I have just purchased an electric car and trialled the car first. I had a board meeting in the west of Ireland, and I did the maths and gauged my range. I would have just enough battery. Unaware that listening to music and heating my seat drastically depletes the battery, the last hour of my trip was a torrid affair. The rural roads had very few houses let alone a charging station to charge my car. As I approached the hotel with everything turned off, the car chugged to a halt as I rolled up to the charger. I made it! No, I didn\\'t. The charger was out of order, so I had to wait until the occupied charger beside it became available. Lesson learned.This polarity of the advantages and disadvantages introduced with any new technology has always existed. Social media connects us yet drives us apart. Virtual work gives us freedom, yet it can enslave us in our own homes. Artificial Intelligence offers efficiency yet replaces jobs. Joseph Schumpeter\\'s \"Creative Destructive\" reflects this duality of pros and cons.Schumpeter argued that new technologies introduce both positive and negative phenomena. The positive is the creation of new markets, products, and ways of doing things. The negative is the destruction of old markets, products, and ways of doing things.Ride-sharing services like Free Now, Uber and Lyft are excellent examples of creative destruction in action. Before the rise of ride-sharing, the taxi industry was dominated by traditional taxi companies that controlled the supply of taxi licenses and operated within a highly regulated environment. However, with the dawn of ride-sharing, the market for traditional taxi companies has declined rapidly.While the decline of the traditional taxi industry destroyed many taxi companies, it created new opportunities for companies that embraced the ride-sharing model. Furthermore, the rise of ride-sharing created new opportunities for companies focused on developing autonomous vehicle technology.When autonomous vehicles become widespread, Schumpeter’s gale will again reposition the tectonic plates of business. Companies like Waymo, Tesla, and Cruise have been working to develop self-driving cars that could be used for ride-sharing, potentially disrupting the industry once again.', 'The increasing adoption of ADAS & safety features, the focus of #governments to enhance vehicle and pedestrian safety, initiatives by OEMs to provide advanced #safety #features, and the advent of new age technologies will surge the demand for .Downlod PDF Brochure @', \"📰 Continuing on technology trends, and building on last week's discussion about the tech trends that are reshaping industries, this week let's delve deeper into the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 🤖🌐🧠 🖥 AI Everywhere: Artificial Intelligence is no longer science fiction - it's our reality.

Currently, less than 10% of the world's energy consumption is carbon-free electricity. Combined with massive eletrification of most activities, we will still rely on fossil derived electricity in the near future. We must therefore also limit the electricity consumption of our transportation systems. This shift necessitates vehicles dedicated to each usage and, for urban use, lightweight, lower-speed design that significantly reduces energy consumption compared to heavy electric cars. However, the ownership model involves individuals purchasing a single, all-encompassing vehicle to meet diverse needs and to fulfill a broad range of requirements such as speed, distance, cargo space, safety, and seating capacity.To change from today cars to optimized vehicles, we must transition from vehicle ownership to “Mobility as a Service”. In this model, people will not own cars but will access the right vehicle for specific needs. This has the potential of dramatically enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, improving experience and allocating urban space more equitably among modes of transportation.When vehicles cannot self-navigate, ensuring the availability of the right shared vehicle at the right time and place is impossible, discouraging car owners from giving up ownership. Shared vehicles, in this context, mostly serve as alternatives to public transport or bicycles, averaging 3 to 4 trips a day. This fails to deliver substantial cost, space, or emission benefits compared to ownership.To facilitate a paradigm shift, shared vehicles must possess level 4 self-driving capabilities, allowing them to reach users when and where they're needed in given areas. Autonomous shared vehicles can operate significantly more frequently, akin to taxis, averaging around 20 trips a day as already current experiments have demonstrated. This dramatic increase in utilization holds the potential for substitution of around 5 cars and a substantial reduction in the number of vehicles on the road.The advantages of this transformation are evident: reduced pollution, lower travel costs, and decreased road congestion. Autonomous vehicles also offer enhanced safety and road infrastructure utilization, efficient driving modes and enable multimodal combinations, creating exciting new mobility experiences.We should not limit self-driving capability to existing modes of transportation such as taxis or busses but reimagine mobility based on people's needs to reduce energy consumption and optimize urban space.Implications on regulations, urban planning and the way players need to rethink their current operating mode and business model are huge.

However, the automotive landscape has transformed significantly since then, with today\\'s vehicles showing a staggering 200 or more onboard sensors.This evolution in sensor quantity and technology is closely aligned with the increasing intelligence and autonomy of vehicles. As automotive engineering propels forward, these sensors continue to advance in sophistication and will undoubtedly multiply as new features become commonplace.This surge in sensor capabilities has sparked innovation across all faces of vehicle design. It\\'s reshaping the vehicle\\'s E/E architecture, while intensifying the complexity of automotive software. The current 100 million lines of code found in vehicles are projected to expand to 300+ million lines by 2030. To put this into perspective, consider that, fueled by data from all sensors, a single car can generate anywhere from 1.4 to 19 Terabytes of data per hour, translating to roughly 380 to 5,100 Terabytes annually.This exponential surge in data generation underscores the urgent necessity for the industry to develop robust strategies to effectively manage and navigate the intricate landscape of this growing code complexity.The future of automotive software is upon us, and it promises not only smarter and more autonomous vehicles but also a profound transformation in how we approach vehicle engineering and design.

As we move to widespread L3/L4 adoption in the medium term, ADAS development and assurance will become increasingly important as we look to innovate the tech, yet protect the consumer.Have a read and thoughts/ comments welcome! Is there anything else within the ADAS ecosystem that we should be focusing on?\"]\n"
