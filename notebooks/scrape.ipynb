After many years of development and (restricted) testing, and not more than 10 days ago, California regulators have given the green light to Cruise (General Motors) and Waymo (Google) to offer commercial robotaxi services 24 hours a day, seven days a week, across the city. Impressed to see that these operators are now ready to shift from testing and piloting to commercially scaling their technologies. The enormous investments of AV start-ups are clearly visible in the San Francisco streets. We were extremely lucky to see and experience ourselves these disruptive ride-hailing services, without a safety driver inside the vehicle. I was really impressed by the level of comfort and safety in all circumstances (day, night, traffic jams, complex traffic situations, ‚Ä¶). Yes, autonomous vehicles are coming. I am convinced that this technology will sooner than later disrupt our urban mobility making it much more safe, efficient, user friendly, environment friendly and affordable for everyone. We had meetings with several government regulators giving us an insight on the complex permit journey and the challenges they still see. It was quite surprising to see how the relatively few AV collisions were making daily the news in San Francisco, while the safety potential is so high compared to human drivers. In our meetings with several government regulators, we received a much better understanding in both underregulating and overregulation AV innovation. The real success of this study trip was bringing together several Belgian stakeholders including federal and regional authorities and public transport operators to see, feel and experience AV. Also in Belgium, structured dialogues with public and private stakeholders will be key to introduce the next level of AV in our country, understanding the positive impact of AV but also to anticipate on unwanted effects like the substitution of public transport or an unwanted uptake of vehicle-kms.

To be fair, the short drive was remarkable. Mario claims that he has driven through San Francisco during rush hour with almost no interventions.But my skepticism about whether Musk can actually pull off autonomous driving using only cameras was only reinforced by this ride.

The rapid evolution of ADAS and self-driving vehicles is steering in a new era of software-defined vehicles.In this highly competitive automotive landscape, the pursuit of cutting-edge trends, such as highly automated driving and full automation, is pushing the boundaries of current engineering capabilities.Just five or six years ago, a new vehicle would typically be equipped with around 60 to 100 sensors. However, the automotive landscape has transformed significantly since then, with today\\'s vehicles showing a staggering 200 or more onboard sensors.This evolution in sensor quantity and technology is closely aligned with the increasing intelligence and autonomy of vehicles. As automotive engineering propels forward, these sensors continue to advance in sophistication and will undoubtedly multiply as new features become commonplace.This surge in sensor capabilities has sparked innovation across all faces of vehicle design. It\\'s reshaping the vehicle\\'s E/E architecture, while intensifying the complexity of automotive software. The current 100 million lines of code found in vehicles are projected to expand to 300+ million lines by 2030. To put this into perspective, consider that, fueled by data from all sensors, a single car can generate anywhere from 1.4 to 19 Terabytes of data per hour, translating to roughly 380 to 5,100 Terabytes annually.This exponential surge in data generation underscores the urgent necessity for the industry to develop robust strategies to effectively manage and navigate the intricate landscape of this growing code complexity.The future of automotive software is upon us, and it promises not only smarter and more autonomous vehicles but also a profound transformation in how we approach vehicle engineering and design.

The rapid evolution of ADAS and self-driving vehicles is steering in a new era of software-defined vehicles.In this highly competitive automotive landscape, the pursuit of cutting-edge trends, such as highly automated driving and full automation, is pushing the boundaries of current engineering capabilities.Just five or six years ago, a new vehicle would typically be equipped with around 60 to 100 sensors. However, the automotive landscape has transformed significantly since then, with today\\'s vehicles showing a staggering 200 or more onboard sensors.This evolution in sensor quantity and technology is closely aligned with the increasing intelligence and autonomy of vehicles. As automotive engineering propels forward, these sensors continue to advance in sophistication and will undoubtedly multiply as new features become commonplace.This surge in sensor capabilities has sparked innovation across all faces of vehicle design. It\\'s reshaping the vehicle\\'s E/E architecture, while intensifying the complexity of automotive software. The current 100 million lines of code found in vehicles are projected to expand to 300+ million lines by 2030. To put this into perspective, consider that, fueled by data from all sensors, a single car can generate anywhere from 1.4 to 19 Terabytes of data per hour, translating to roughly 380 to 5,100 Terabytes annually.This exponential surge in data generation underscores the urgent necessity for the industry to develop robust strategies to effectively manage and navigate the intricate landscape of this growing code complexity.The future of automotive software is upon us, and it promises not only smarter and more autonomous vehicles but also a profound transformation in how we approach vehicle engineering and design.

I expect to see more pilot programs and autonomous ride-share services hitting the streets this, and specially next year. This could transform how we commute and travel within cities in the near future.Also, one of the primary promises of self-driving technology is improved road safety. Self-driving systems are becoming more sophisticated and better at avoiding accidents every day, getting closer to the goal of almost no-accidents.But, what would happen if the AI in the car needs to chose between the saftely of the car occupants and the pedestrians?Governments and regulatory bodies are working to establish guidelines and rules for self-driving vehicles. In 2024, we can expect to see more standardized regulations but there are many ethical questions to solve like the one I just posted above.Another important factor I would like to remark is connectivity, because self-driving cars are not just about autonomy; they are also about connectivity, with other vehicles (V2V) and also vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I). The communication and shared data between them will help avoiding accidents but also reducing traffic congestion, for instance.Autonomous vehicle testing is ramping up and major automakers, tech companies, and startups are conducting extensive trials to fine-tune their self-driving systems, not only in passenger vehicles but also in long-haul trucks and public transportation.The race to lead in self-driving technology continues to be fierce. Companies from various countries are competing to develop the most advanced autonomous systems and prove their capabilities to reduce traffic congestion and improve fuel efficiency through optimized driving patterns.While self-driving technology is really promising, the level 5 of car full-driving autonomy is still to be reached.In the meantime, keep an eye on the road and drive safely, because the roads are still crowded with ineficient drivers nervious to reach destination ;0    ', 'At #ANCongress this week, Chris Urmson ‚Äî one of the founding members of Google‚Äôs self-driving car project and now the CEO and co-founder of Aurora Innovation ‚Äî said the company‚Äôs self-driving technology is expected to be ‚Äúfeature complete,‚Äù next year.

The rapid evolution of ADAS and self-driving vehicles is steering in a new era of software-defined vehicles.In this highly competitive automotive landscape, the pursuit of cutting-edge trends, such as highly automated driving and full automation, is pushing the boundaries of current engineering capabilities.Just five or six years ago, a new vehicle would typically be equipped with around 60 to 100 sensors. However, the automotive landscape has transformed significantly since then, with today\\'s vehicles showing a staggering 200 or more onboard sensors.This evolution in sensor quantity and technology is closely aligned with the increasing intelligence and autonomy of vehicles. As automotive engineering propels forward, these sensors continue to advance in sophistication and will undoubtedly multiply as new features become commonplace.This surge in sensor capabilities has sparked innovation across all faces of vehicle design. It\\'s reshaping the vehicle\\'s E/E architecture, while intensifying the complexity of automotive software. The current 100 million lines of code found in vehicles are projected to expand to 300+ million lines by 2030. To put this into perspective, consider that, fueled by data from all sensors, a single car can generate anywhere from 1.4 to 19 Terabytes of data per hour, translating to roughly 380 to 5,100 Terabytes annually.This exponential surge in data generation underscores the urgent necessity for the industry to develop robust strategies to effectively manage and navigate the intricate landscape of this growing code complexity.The future of automotive software is upon us, and it promises not only smarter and more autonomous vehicles but also a profound transformation in how we approach vehicle engineering and design.

The rapid evolution of ADAS and self-driving vehicles is steering in a new era of software-defined vehicles.In this highly competitive automotive landscape, the pursuit of cutting-edge trends, such as highly automated driving and full automation, is pushing the boundaries of current engineering capabilities.Just five or six years ago, a new vehicle would typically be equipped with around 60 to 100 sensors. However, the automotive landscape has transformed significantly since then, with today\\'s vehicles showing a staggering 200 or more onboard sensors.This evolution in sensor quantity and technology is closely aligned with the increasing intelligence and autonomy of vehicles. As automotive engineering propels forward, these sensors continue to advance in sophistication and will undoubtedly multiply as new features become commonplace.This surge in sensor capabilities has sparked innovation across all faces of vehicle design. It\\'s reshaping the vehicle\\'s E/E architecture, while intensifying the complexity of automotive software. The current 100 million lines of code found in vehicles are projected to expand to 300+ million lines by 2030. To put this into perspective, consider that, fueled by data from all sensors, a single car can generate anywhere from 1.4 to 19 Terabytes of data per hour, translating to roughly 380 to 5,100 Terabytes annually.This exponential surge in data generation underscores the urgent necessity for the industry to develop robust strategies to effectively manage and navigate the intricate landscape of this growing code complexity.The future of automotive software is upon us, and it promises not only smarter and more autonomous vehicles but also a profound transformation in how we approach vehicle engineering and design.

However, pandemic-related shocks to the automobile sector, a move toward investing in electric vehicles, and the utter complexity of the technology have all contributed to the autonomous-driving revolution stalling. For now, we have several types of autonomous driving. Though, some of them still do request driver‚Äôs involvement in specific situations.Mercedes-Benz has won worldwide clearance for its \"level three\" autonomous driving system in compliance with United Nations regulations, putting it ahead of the competition.Hands-free level three provides autonomous driving in some scenarios, such as heavy traffic or highway speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour (37 miles per hour). Drivers may take their sights off the road, but they must be prepared to take action if necessary.However, the great majority of today\\'s commercially accessible automobiles have just \"level two\" partial automation. This includes Tesla\\'s well-known \"autopilot\" which provides features like as adaptive cruise control and automated parking ‚Äì all while the driver maintains full control.Finally, \"level four\" cars, such as Waymo or Cruise\\'s robot autos, may function without ant human involvement within defined zones.There is an assumption that autonomous vehicles will eventually be such a significant improvement over human-driven cars ‚Äî providing safer, cheaper, more efficient transportation that can replace car ownership ‚Äî that we should allow companies to experiment and tolerate some disruption. And it is quite fair, this technology has a lot of promise for safer driving without human factor.However, there is no certainty that self-driving cars will solve all transportation issues. It\\'s highly possible that self-driving vehicles would worsen traffic jams by repeatedly looping blocks between passengers.Companies that give autonomous car experiences, on the other hand, have received tremendous hostility, not only from citizens of various cities, but also from government officials and law enforcement.

We had meetings with several government regulators giving us an insight on the complex permit journey and the challenges they still see. It was quite surprising to see how the relatively few AV collisions were making daily the news in San Francisco, while the safety potential is so high compared to human drivers. In our meetings with several government regulators, we received a much better understanding in both underregulating and overregulation AV innovation. The real success of this study trip was bringing together several Belgian stakeholders including federal and regional authorities and public transport operators to see, feel and experience AV. Also in Belgium, structured dialogues with public and private stakeholders will be key to introduce the next level of AV in our country, understanding the positive impact of AV but also to anticipate on unwanted effects like the substitution of public transport or an unwanted uptake of vehicle-kms.

The rapid evolution of ADAS and self-driving vehicles is steering in a new era of software-defined vehicles.In this highly competitive automotive landscape, the pursuit of cutting-edge trends, such as highly automated driving and full automation, is pushing the boundaries of current engineering capabilities.Just five or six years ago, a new vehicle would typically be equipped with around 60 to 100 sensors. However, the automotive landscape has transformed significantly since then, with today\\'s vehicles showing a staggering 200 or more onboard sensors.This evolution in sensor quantity and technology is closely aligned with the increasing intelligence and autonomy of vehicles. As automotive engineering propels forward, these sensors continue to advance in sophistication and will undoubtedly multiply as new features become commonplace.This surge in sensor capabilities has sparked innovation across all faces of vehicle design. It\\'s reshaping the vehicle\\'s E/E architecture, while intensifying the complexity of automotive software. The current 100 million lines of code found in vehicles are projected to expand to 300+ million lines by 2030. To put this into perspective, consider that, fueled by data from all sensors, a single car can generate anywhere from 1.4 to 19 Terabytes of data per hour, translating to roughly 380 to 5,100 Terabytes annually.This exponential surge in data generation underscores the urgent necessity for the industry to develop robust strategies to effectively manage and navigate the intricate landscape of this growing code complexity.The future of automotive software is upon us, and it promises not only smarter and more autonomous vehicles but also a profound transformation in how we approach vehicle engineering and design.

However, pandemic-related shocks to the automobile sector, a move toward investing in electric vehicles, and the utter complexity of the technology have all contributed to the autonomous-driving revolution stalling. For now, we have several types of autonomous driving. Though, some of them still do request driver‚Äôs involvement in specific situations.Mercedes-Benz has won worldwide clearance for its \"level three\" autonomous driving system in compliance with United Nations regulations, putting it ahead of the competition.Hands-free level three provides autonomous driving in some scenarios, such as heavy traffic or highway speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour (37 miles per hour). Drivers may take their sights off the road, but they must be prepared to take action if necessary.However, the great majority of today\\'s commercially accessible automobiles have just \"level two\" partial automation. This includes Tesla\\'s well-known \"autopilot\" which provides features like as adaptive cruise control and automated parking ‚Äì all while the driver maintains full control.Finally, \"level four\" cars, such as Waymo or Cruise\\'s robot autos, may function without ant human involvement within defined zones.There is an assumption that autonomous vehicles will eventually be such a significant improvement over human-driven cars ‚Äî providing safer, cheaper, more efficient transportation that can replace car ownership ‚Äî that we should allow companies to experiment and tolerate some disruption. And it is quite fair, this technology has a lot of promise for safer driving without human factor.However, there is no certainty that self-driving cars will solve all transportation issues. It\\'s highly possible that self-driving vehicles would worsen traffic jams by repeatedly looping blocks between passengers.Companies that give autonomous car experiences, on the other hand, have received tremendous hostility, not only from citizens of various cities, but also from government officials and law enforcement. People have voiced fear that robot cars will harm jobs or undermine attempts to reduce general car ownership. ', \"Tesla is the most valuable car manufacturer, with a market cap of over üí≤850B.

After many years of development and (restricted) testing, and not more than 10 days ago, California regulators have given the green light to Cruise (General Motors) and Waymo (Google) to offer commercial robotaxi services 24 hours a day, seven days a week, across the city. Impressed to see that these operators are now ready to shift from testing and piloting to commercially scaling their technologies. The enormous investments of AV start-ups are clearly visible in the San Francisco streets. We were extremely lucky to see and experience ourselves these disruptive ride-hailing services, without a safety driver inside the vehicle. I was really impressed by the level of comfort and safety in all circumstances (day, night, traffic jams, complex traffic situations, ‚Ä¶). Yes, autonomous vehicles are coming. I am convinced that this technology will sooner than later disrupt our urban mobility making it much more safe, efficient, user friendly, environment friendly and affordable for everyone. We had meetings with several government regulators giving us an insight on the complex permit journey and the challenges they still see. It was quite surprising to see how the relatively few AV collisions were making daily the news in San Francisco, while the safety potential is so high compared to human drivers. In our meetings with several government regulators, we received a much better understanding in both underregulating and overregulation AV innovation. The real success of this study trip was bringing together several Belgian stakeholders including federal and regional authorities and public transport operators to see, feel and experience AV. Also in Belgium, structured dialogues with public and private stakeholders will be key to introduce the next level of AV in our country, understanding the positive impact of AV but also to anticipate on unwanted effects like the substitution of public transport or an unwanted uptake of vehicle-kms.

The rapid evolution of ADAS and self-driving vehicles is steering in a new era of software-defined vehicles.In this highly competitive automotive landscape, the pursuit of cutting-edge trends, such as highly automated driving and full automation, is pushing the boundaries of current engineering capabilities.Just five or six years ago, a new vehicle would typically be equipped with around 60 to 100 sensors. However, the automotive landscape has transformed significantly since then, with today\\'s vehicles showing a staggering 200 or more onboard sensors.This evolution in sensor quantity and technology is closely aligned with the increasing intelligence and autonomy of vehicles. As automotive engineering propels forward, these sensors continue to advance in sophistication and will undoubtedly multiply as new features become commonplace.This surge in sensor capabilities has sparked innovation across all faces of vehicle design. It\\'s reshaping the vehicle\\'s E/E architecture, while intensifying the complexity of automotive software. The current 100 million lines of code found in vehicles are projected to expand to 300+ million lines by 2030. To put this into perspective, consider that, fueled by data from all sensors, a single car can generate anywhere from 1.4 to 19 Terabytes of data per hour, translating to roughly 380 to 5,100 Terabytes annually.This exponential surge in data generation underscores the urgent necessity for the industry to develop robust strategies to effectively manage and navigate the intricate landscape of this growing code complexity.The future of automotive software is upon us, and it promises not only smarter and more autonomous vehicles but also a profound transformation in how we approach vehicle engineering and design.

I expect to see more pilot programs and autonomous ride-share services hitting the streets this, and specially next year. This could transform how we commute and travel within cities in the near future.Also, one of the primary promises of self-driving technology is improved road safety. Self-driving systems are becoming more sophisticated and better at avoiding accidents every day, getting closer to the goal of almost no-accidents.But, what would happen if the AI in the car needs to chose between the saftely of the car occupants and the pedestrians?Governments and regulatory bodies are working to establish guidelines and rules for self-driving vehicles. In 2024, we can expect to see more standardized regulations but there are many ethical questions to solve like the one I just posted above.Another important factor I would like to remark is connectivity, because self-driving cars are not just about autonomy; they are also about connectivity, with other vehicles (V2V) and also vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I). The communication and shared data between them will help avoiding accidents but also reducing traffic congestion, for instance.Autonomous vehicle testing is ramping up and major automakers, tech companies, and startups are conducting extensive trials to fine-tune their self-driving systems, not only in passenger vehicles but also in long-haul trucks and public transportation.The race to lead in self-driving technology continues to be fierce. Companies from various countries are competing to develop the most advanced autonomous systems and prove their capabilities to reduce traffic congestion and improve fuel efficiency through optimized driving patterns.While self-driving technology is really promising, the level 5 of car full-driving autonomy is still to be reached.In the meantime, keep an eye on the road and drive safely, because the roads are still crowded with ineficient drivers nervious to reach destination ;0    ', 'At #ANCongress this week, Chris Urmson ‚Äî one of the founding members of Google‚Äôs self-driving car project and now the CEO and co-founder of Aurora Innovation ‚Äî said the company‚Äôs self-driving technology is expected to be ‚Äúfeature complete,‚Äù next year.

For now, we have several types of autonomous driving. Though, some of them still do request driver‚Äôs involvement in specific situations.Mercedes-Benz has won worldwide clearance for its \"level three\" autonomous driving system in compliance with United Nations regulations, putting it ahead of the competition.Hands-free level three provides autonomous driving in some scenarios, such as heavy traffic or highway speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour (37 miles per hour). Drivers may take their sights off the road, but they must be prepared to take action if necessary.However, the great majority of today\\'s commercially accessible automobiles have just \"level two\" partial automation. This includes Tesla\\'s well-known \"autopilot\" which provides features like as adaptive cruise control and automated parking ‚Äì all while the driver maintains full control.Finally, \"level four\" cars, such as Waymo or Cruise\\'s robot autos, may function without ant human involvement within defined zones.There is an assumption that autonomous vehicles will eventually be such a significant improvement over human-driven cars ‚Äî providing safer, cheaper, more efficient transportation that can replace car ownership ‚Äî that we should allow companies to experiment and tolerate some disruption. And it is quite fair, this technology has a lot of promise for safer driving without human factor.However, there is no certainty that self-driving cars will solve all transportation issues. It\\'s highly possible that self-driving vehicles would worsen traffic jams by repeatedly looping blocks between passengers.Companies that give autonomous car experiences, on the other hand, have received tremendous hostility, not only from citizens of various cities, but also from government officials and law enforcement.

The next article, How to Collapse any ODD into a Tractable and Solvable model will be published in Autonomous Vehicle International soon. The short version has been edited and is ready for release, the longer version is 60 pages and will be made available for download. Nondeterministic models require a comparative memory of correctness in order to sort out correct/incorrect and safe/unsafe newly made relationships. They also need to know that the vehicle can fit between and pass and stop at a safe distance. The HARA, as approached by 7FM will provide a useful comparative memory for such use as well a better lesson plan. Driving and figuring out why a human steers and brakes avoids the need to figure out how to write the code. It produces an erratic driver that does not know safe from unsafe. Self-learning models only learn AFTER a crash, or it is observed performing a wrong decision. This is the make-test-fix design process, and it will NEVER produce a safe design.Autonomy can perform correct/incorrect throttle, braking, and steering.

The rapid evolution of ADAS and self-driving vehicles is steering in a new era of software-defined vehicles.In this highly competitive automotive landscape, the pursuit of cutting-edge trends, such as highly automated driving and full automation, is pushing the boundaries of current engineering capabilities.Just five or six years ago, a new vehicle would typically be equipped with around 60 to 100 sensors. However, the automotive landscape has transformed significantly since then, with today\\'s vehicles showing a staggering 200 or more onboard sensors.This evolution in sensor quantity and technology is closely aligned with the increasing intelligence and autonomy of vehicles. As automotive engineering propels forward, these sensors continue to advance in sophistication and will undoubtedly multiply as new features become commonplace.This surge in sensor capabilities has sparked innovation across all faces of vehicle design. It\\'s reshaping the vehicle\\'s E/E architecture, while intensifying the complexity of automotive software. The current 100 million lines of code found in vehicles are projected to expand to 300+ million lines by 2030. To put this into perspective, consider that, fueled by data from all sensors, a single car can generate anywhere from 1.4 to 19 Terabytes of data per hour, translating to roughly 380 to 5,100 Terabytes annually.This exponential surge in data generation underscores the urgent necessity for the industry to develop robust strategies to effectively manage and navigate the intricate landscape of this growing code complexity.The future of automotive software is upon us, and it promises not only smarter and more autonomous vehicles but also a profound transformation in how we approach vehicle engineering and design.

However, pandemic-related shocks to the automobile sector, a move toward investing in electric vehicles, and the utter complexity of the technology have all contributed to the autonomous-driving revolution stalling. For now, we have several types of autonomous driving. Though, some of them still do request driver‚Äôs involvement in specific situations.Mercedes-Benz has won worldwide clearance for its \"level three\" autonomous driving system in compliance with United Nations regulations, putting it ahead of the competition.Hands-free level three provides autonomous driving in some scenarios, such as heavy traffic or highway speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour (37 miles per hour). Drivers may take their sights off the road, but they must be prepared to take action if necessary.However, the great majority of today\\'s commercially accessible automobiles have just \"level two\" partial automation. This includes Tesla\\'s well-known \"autopilot\" which provides features like as adaptive cruise control and automated parking ‚Äì all while the driver maintains full control.Finally, \"level four\" cars, such as Waymo or Cruise\\'s robot autos, may function without ant human involvement within defined zones.There is an assumption that autonomous vehicles will eventually be such a significant improvement over human-driven cars ‚Äî providing safer, cheaper, more efficient transportation that can replace car ownership ‚Äî that we should allow companies to experiment and tolerate some disruption. And it is quite fair, this technology has a lot of promise for safer driving without human factor.However, there is no certainty that self-driving cars will solve all transportation issues. It\\'s highly possible that self-driving vehicles would worsen traffic jams by repeatedly looping blocks between passengers.Companies that give autonomous car experiences, on the other hand, have received tremendous hostility, not only from citizens of various cities, but also from government officials and law enforcement.

The next article, How to Collapse any ODD into a Tractable and Solvable model will be published in Autonomous Vehicle International soon. The short version has been edited and is ready for release, the longer version is 60 pages and will be made available for download. Nondeterministic models require a comparative memory of correctness in order to sort out correct/incorrect and safe/unsafe newly made relationships. They also need to know that the vehicle can fit between and pass and stop at a safe distance. The HARA, as approached by 7FM will provide a useful comparative memory for such use as well a better lesson plan. Driving and figuring out why a human steers and brakes avoids the need to figure out how to write the code. It produces an erratic driver that does not know safe from unsafe. Self-learning models only learn AFTER a crash, or it is observed performing a wrong decision. This is the make-test-fix design process, and it will NEVER produce a safe design.Autonomy can perform correct/incorrect throttle, braking, and steering. Safety means that autonomy knows WHY the commands are safe.This is the evidence required to ship autonomy to an OEM truck/vehicle manufacturer.', \"As we see EVs starting to flip from early adopter (myself in 2017) to mass market adoption so much has already changed. $40K was the minimum cost of an EV, and now it is $27K. 50kW maximum charging is now beyond 300kW for passenger EVs turning the FASTEST charging time from 1 hour to 10 minutes (, , ).Some vehicles have solar (, , ) , Some vehicles have bidirectional charging (, )Some vehicles have wireless charging ()Some vehicles have driving computers with adaptive cruise control and lane correction and pedestrian braking (, ) and even blockchain mining ().A truly revolutionary product will incorporate all of these ( , charging, , ).But the revolution is already rolling, as more and more people enjoy the benefits and share their experiences with friends and family, coworkers, and employers.

The rapid evolution of ADAS and self-driving vehicles is steering in a new era of software-defined vehicles.In this highly competitive automotive landscape, the pursuit of cutting-edge trends, such as highly automated driving and full automation, is pushing the boundaries of current engineering capabilities.Just five or six years ago, a new vehicle would typically be equipped with around 60 to 100 sensors. However, the automotive landscape has transformed significantly since then, with today\\'s vehicles showing a staggering 200 or more onboard sensors.This evolution in sensor quantity and technology is closely aligned with the increasing intelligence and autonomy of vehicles. As automotive engineering propels forward, these sensors continue to advance in sophistication and will undoubtedly multiply as new features become commonplace.This surge in sensor capabilities has sparked innovation across all faces of vehicle design. It\\'s reshaping the vehicle\\'s E/E architecture, while intensifying the complexity of automotive software. The current 100 million lines of code found in vehicles are projected to expand to 300+ million lines by 2030. To put this into perspective, consider that, fueled by data from all sensors, a single car can generate anywhere from 1.4 to 19 Terabytes of data per hour, translating to roughly 380 to 5,100 Terabytes annually.This exponential surge in data generation underscores the urgent necessity for the industry to develop robust strategies to effectively manage and navigate the intricate landscape of this growing code complexity.The future of automotive software is upon us, and it promises not only smarter and more autonomous vehicles but also a profound transformation in how we approach vehicle engineering and design.

I expect to see more pilot programs and autonomous ride-share services hitting the streets this, and specially next year. This could transform how we commute and travel within cities in the near future.Also, one of the primary promises of self-driving technology is improved road safety. Self-driving systems are becoming more sophisticated and better at avoiding accidents every day, getting closer to the goal of almost no-accidents.But, what would happen if the AI in the car needs to chose between the saftely of the car occupants and the pedestrians?Governments and regulatory bodies are working to establish guidelines and rules for self-driving vehicles. In 2024, we can expect to see more standardized regulations but there are many ethical questions to solve like the one I just posted above.Another important factor I would like to remark is connectivity, because self-driving cars are not just about autonomy; they are also about connectivity, with other vehicles (V2V) and also vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I). The communication and shared data between them will help avoiding accidents but also reducing traffic congestion, for instance.Autonomous vehicle testing is ramping up and major automakers, tech companies, and startups are conducting extensive trials to fine-tune their self-driving systems, not only in passenger vehicles but also in long-haul trucks and public transportation.The race to lead in self-driving technology continues to be fierce. Companies from various countries are competing to develop the most advanced autonomous systems and prove their capabilities to reduce traffic congestion and improve fuel efficiency through optimized driving patterns.While self-driving technology is really promising, the level 5 of car full-driving autonomy is still to be reached.In the meantime, keep an eye on the road and drive safely, because the roads are still crowded with ineficient drivers nervious to reach destination ;0    ', 'At #ANCongress this week, Chris Urmson ‚Äî one of the founding members of Google‚Äôs self-driving car project and now the CEO and co-founder of Aurora Innovation ‚Äî said the company‚Äôs self-driving technology is expected to be ‚Äúfeature complete,‚Äù next year.

However, pandemic-related shocks to the automobile sector, a move toward investing in electric vehicles, and the utter complexity of the technology have all contributed to the autonomous-driving revolution stalling. For now, we have several types of autonomous driving. Though, some of them still do request driver‚Äôs involvement in specific situations.Mercedes-Benz has won worldwide clearance for its \"level three\" autonomous driving system in compliance with United Nations regulations, putting it ahead of the competition.Hands-free level three provides autonomous driving in some scenarios, such as heavy traffic or highway speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour (37 miles per hour). Drivers may take their sights off the road, but they must be prepared to take action if necessary.However, the great majority of today\\'s commercially accessible automobiles have just \"level two\" partial automation. This includes Tesla\\'s well-known \"autopilot\" which provides features like as adaptive cruise control and automated parking ‚Äì all while the driver maintains full control.Finally, \"level four\" cars, such as Waymo or Cruise\\'s robot autos, may function without ant human involvement within defined zones.There is an assumption that autonomous vehicles will eventually be such a significant improvement over human-driven cars ‚Äî providing safer, cheaper, more efficient transportation that can replace car ownership ‚Äî that we should allow companies to experiment and tolerate some disruption. And it is quite fair, this technology has a lot of promise for safer driving without human factor.However, there is no certainty that self-driving cars will solve all transportation issues. It\\'s highly possible that self-driving vehicles would worsen traffic jams by repeatedly looping blocks between passengers.Companies that give autonomous car experiences, on the other hand, have received tremendous hostility, not only from citizens of various cities, but also from government officials and law enforcement.

Currently, less than 10% of the world's energy consumption is carbon-free electricity. Combined with massive eletrification of most activities, we will still rely on fossil derived electricity in the near future. We must therefore also limit the electricity consumption of our transportation systems. This shift necessitates vehicles dedicated to each usage and, for urban use, lightweight, lower-speed design that significantly reduces energy consumption compared to heavy electric cars. However, the ownership model involves individuals purchasing a single, all-encompassing vehicle to meet diverse needs and to fulfill a broad range of requirements such as speed, distance, cargo space, safety, and seating capacity.To change from today cars to optimized vehicles, we must transition from vehicle ownership to ‚ÄúMobility as a Service‚Äù. In this model, people will not own cars but will access the right vehicle for specific needs. This has the potential of dramatically enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, improving experience and allocating urban space more equitably among modes of transportation.When vehicles cannot self-navigate, ensuring the availability of the right shared vehicle at the right time and place is impossible, discouraging car owners from giving up ownership. Shared vehicles, in this context, mostly serve as alternatives to public transport or bicycles, averaging 3 to 4 trips a day. This fails to deliver substantial cost, space, or emission benefits compared to ownership.To facilitate a paradigm shift, shared vehicles must possess level 4 self-driving capabilities, allowing them to reach users when and where they're needed in given areas. Autonomous shared vehicles can operate significantly more frequently, akin to taxis, averaging around 20 trips a day as already current experiments have demonstrated. This dramatic increase in utilization holds the potential for substitution of around 5 cars and a substantial reduction in the number of vehicles on the road.The advantages of this transformation are evident: reduced pollution, lower travel costs, and decreased road congestion. Autonomous vehicles also offer enhanced safety and road infrastructure utilization, efficient driving modes and enable multimodal combinations, creating exciting new mobility experiences.We should not limit self-driving capability to existing modes of transportation such as taxis or busses but reimagine mobility based on people's needs to reduce energy consumption and optimize urban space.Implications on regulations, urban planning and the way players need to rethink their current operating mode and business model are huge. Self-driving capability represents the crucial missing link in our quest to zero carbon mobility and more livable cities.We need to start this journey now.Read the full article below.\", \"Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are three interconnected fields that play a significant role in the world of technology and data-driven decision-making.

The rapid evolution of ADAS and self-driving vehicles is steering in a new era of software-defined vehicles.In this highly competitive automotive landscape, the pursuit of cutting-edge trends, such as highly automated driving and full automation, is pushing the boundaries of current engineering capabilities.Just five or six years ago, a new vehicle would typically be equipped with around 60 to 100 sensors. However, the automotive landscape has transformed significantly since then, with today\\'s vehicles showing a staggering 200 or more onboard sensors.This evolution in sensor quantity and technology is closely aligned with the increasing intelligence and autonomy of vehicles. As automotive engineering propels forward, these sensors continue to advance in sophistication and will undoubtedly multiply as new features become commonplace.This surge in sensor capabilities has sparked innovation across all faces of vehicle design. It\\'s reshaping the vehicle\\'s E/E architecture, while intensifying the complexity of automotive software. The current 100 million lines of code found in vehicles are projected to expand to 300+ million lines by 2030. To put this into perspective, consider that, fueled by data from all sensors, a single car can generate anywhere from 1.4 to 19 Terabytes of data per hour, translating to roughly 380 to 5,100 Terabytes annually.This exponential surge in data generation underscores the urgent necessity for the industry to develop robust strategies to effectively manage and navigate the intricate landscape of this growing code complexity.The future of automotive software is upon us, and it promises not only smarter and more autonomous vehicles but also a profound transformation in how we approach vehicle engineering and design.

However, pandemic-related shocks to the automobile sector, a move toward investing in electric vehicles, and the utter complexity of the technology have all contributed to the autonomous-driving revolution stalling. For now, we have several types of autonomous driving. Though, some of them still do request driver‚Äôs involvement in specific situations.Mercedes-Benz has won worldwide clearance for its \"level three\" autonomous driving system in compliance with United Nations regulations, putting it ahead of the competition.Hands-free level three provides autonomous driving in some scenarios, such as heavy traffic or highway speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour (37 miles per hour). Drivers may take their sights off the road, but they must be prepared to take action if necessary.However, the great majority of today\\'s commercially accessible automobiles have just \"level two\" partial automation. This includes Tesla\\'s well-known \"autopilot\" which provides features like as adaptive cruise control and automated parking ‚Äì all while the driver maintains full control.Finally, \"level four\" cars, such as Waymo or Cruise\\'s robot autos, may function without ant human involvement within defined zones.There is an assumption that autonomous vehicles will eventually be such a significant improvement over human-driven cars ‚Äî providing safer, cheaper, more efficient transportation that can replace car ownership ‚Äî that we should allow companies to experiment and tolerate some disruption. And it is quite fair, this technology has a lot of promise for safer driving without human factor.However, there is no certainty that self-driving cars will solve all transportation issues. It\\'s highly possible that self-driving vehicles would worsen traffic jams by repeatedly looping blocks between passengers.Companies that give autonomous car experiences, on the other hand, have received tremendous hostility, not only from citizens of various cities, but also from government officials and law enforcement.

Nondeterministic models require a comparative memory of correctness in order to sort out correct/incorrect and safe/unsafe newly made relationships. They also need to know that the vehicle can fit between and pass and stop at a safe distance. The HARA, as approached by 7FM will provide a useful comparative memory for such use as well a better lesson plan. Driving and figuring out why a human steers and brakes avoids the need to figure out how to write the code. It produces an erratic driver that does not know safe from unsafe.

Currently, less than 10% of the world's energy consumption is carbon-free electricity. Combined with massive eletrification of most activities, we will still rely on fossil derived electricity in the near future. We must therefore also limit the electricity consumption of our transportation systems. This shift necessitates vehicles dedicated to each usage and, for urban use, lightweight, lower-speed design that significantly reduces energy consumption compared to heavy electric cars. However, the ownership model involves individuals purchasing a single, all-encompassing vehicle to meet diverse needs and to fulfill a broad range of requirements such as speed, distance, cargo space, safety, and seating capacity.To change from today cars to optimized vehicles, we must transition from vehicle ownership to ‚ÄúMobility as a Service‚Äù. In this model, people will not own cars but will access the right vehicle for specific needs. This has the potential of dramatically enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, improving experience and allocating urban space more equitably among modes of transportation.When vehicles cannot self-navigate, ensuring the availability of the right shared vehicle at the right time and place is impossible, discouraging car owners from giving up ownership. Shared vehicles, in this context, mostly serve as alternatives to public transport or bicycles, averaging 3 to 4 trips a day. This fails to deliver substantial cost, space, or emission benefits compared to ownership.To facilitate a paradigm shift, shared vehicles must possess level 4 self-driving capabilities, allowing them to reach users when and where they're needed in given areas. Autonomous shared vehicles can operate significantly more frequently, akin to taxis, averaging around 20 trips a day as already current experiments have demonstrated. This dramatic increase in utilization holds the potential for substitution of around 5 cars and a substantial reduction in the number of vehicles on the road.The advantages of this transformation are evident: reduced pollution, lower travel costs, and decreased road congestion. Autonomous vehicles also offer enhanced safety and road infrastructure utilization, efficient driving modes and enable multimodal combinations, creating exciting new mobility experiences.We should not limit self-driving capability to existing modes of transportation such as taxis or busses but reimagine mobility based on people's needs to reduce energy consumption and optimize urban space.Implications on regulations, urban planning and the way players need to rethink their current operating mode and business model are huge. Self-driving capability represents the crucial missing link in our quest to zero carbon mobility and more livable cities.We need to start this journey now.Read the full article below.\", \"Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are three interconnected fields that play a significant role in the world of technology and data-driven decision-making.

The enormous investments of AV start-ups are clearly visible in the San Francisco streets. We were extremely lucky to see and experience ourselves these disruptive ride-hailing services, without a safety driver inside the vehicle. I was really impressed by the level of comfort and safety in all circumstances (day, night, traffic jams, complex traffic situations, ‚Ä¶). Yes, autonomous vehicles are coming. I am convinced that this technology will sooner than later disrupt our urban mobility making it much more safe, efficient, user friendly, environment friendly and affordable for everyone. We had meetings with several government regulators giving us an insight on the complex permit journey and the challenges they still see. It was quite surprising to see how the relatively few AV collisions were making daily the news in San Francisco, while the safety potential is so high compared to human drivers. In our meetings with several government regulators, we received a much better understanding in both underregulating and overregulation AV innovation. The real success of this study trip was bringing together several Belgian stakeholders including federal and regional authorities and public transport operators to see, feel and experience AV. Also in Belgium, structured dialogues with public and private stakeholders will be key to introduce the next level of AV in our country, understanding the positive impact of AV but also to anticipate on unwanted effects like the substitution of public transport or an unwanted uptake of vehicle-kms. The real success of this study trip was by bringing together many Belgian stakeholders active in the mobility ecosystem exploring and experiencing the potential of AV and reflecting on next steps in Belgium.

The rapid evolution of ADAS and self-driving vehicles is steering in a new era of software-defined vehicles.In this highly competitive automotive landscape, the pursuit of cutting-edge trends, such as highly automated driving and full automation, is pushing the boundaries of current engineering capabilities.Just five or six years ago, a new vehicle would typically be equipped with around 60 to 100 sensors. However, the automotive landscape has transformed significantly since then, with today\\'s vehicles showing a staggering 200 or more onboard sensors.This evolution in sensor quantity and technology is closely aligned with the increasing intelligence and autonomy of vehicles. As automotive engineering propels forward, these sensors continue to advance in sophistication and will undoubtedly multiply as new features become commonplace.This surge in sensor capabilities has sparked innovation across all faces of vehicle design. It\\'s reshaping the vehicle\\'s E/E architecture, while intensifying the complexity of automotive software. The current 100 million lines of code found in vehicles are projected to expand to 300+ million lines by 2030. To put this into perspective, consider that, fueled by data from all sensors, a single car can generate anywhere from 1.4 to 19 Terabytes of data per hour, translating to roughly 380 to 5,100 Terabytes annually.This exponential surge in data generation underscores the urgent necessity for the industry to develop robust strategies to effectively manage and navigate the intricate landscape of this growing code complexity.The future of automotive software is upon us, and it promises not only smarter and more autonomous vehicles but also a profound transformation in how we approach vehicle engineering and design.

In fact, he is already using it.\"There are tangible benefits that come with the introduction of autonomous drive technologies,\" Ewing told LinkedIn News Europe.Ewing uses advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) when on the motorway and A-roads to control his speed and keep in lane, as well as in heavy traffic.\"[It] adds a layer of protection in my driving and alleviates some of the pain points when driving on long straight roads or in high traffic scenarios,\" he said.Such technology is classed as between Level 2 on the six-stage scale of self-driving cars, with six being the ability for a car to make a journey without any human interaction. By contrast, cruise control is level one, and the European Commission is yet to approve level three, which would still leave the driver in ultimate control of the vehicle. So it is early days.But for the time being, that may be enough. Even Ewing still enjoys driving the old fashioned way.\"On a quiet cross country journey, I love to drive the car myself,\" he said.Ewing points out that 90% of road traffic accidents are a result of human error, and fully-automated systems are predicted to make driving safer and much more efficient.\"Once cars are able to drive without any human intervention at all, there will also be significant time savings as people are freed up from their hours currently spent at the wheel,\" he said.Do you use self-driving car technology?

The next article, How to Collapse any ODD into a Tractable and Solvable model will be published in Autonomous Vehicle International soon. The short version has been edited and is ready for release, the longer version is 60 pages and will be made available for download. Nondeterministic models require a comparative memory of correctness in order to sort out correct/incorrect and safe/unsafe newly made relationships. They also need to know that the vehicle can fit between and pass and stop at a safe distance. The HARA, as approached by 7FM will provide a useful comparative memory for such use as well a better lesson plan. Driving and figuring out why a human steers and brakes avoids the need to figure out how to write the code. It produces an erratic driver that does not know safe from unsafe. Self-learning models only learn AFTER a crash, or it is observed performing a wrong decision. This is the make-test-fix design process, and it will NEVER produce a safe design.Autonomy can perform correct/incorrect throttle, braking, and steering. Safety means that autonomy knows WHY the commands are safe.This is the evidence required to ship autonomy to an OEM truck/vehicle manufacturer.', \"As we see EVs starting to flip from early adopter (myself in 2017) to mass market adoption so much has already changed. $40K was the minimum cost of an EV, and now it is $27K. 50kW maximum charging is now beyond 300kW for passenger EVs turning the FASTEST charging time from 1 hour to 10 minutes (, , ).Some vehicles have solar (, , ) , Some vehicles have bidirectional charging (, )Some vehicles have wireless charging ()Some vehicles have driving computers with adaptive cruise control and lane correction and pedestrian braking (, ) and even blockchain mining ().A truly revolutionary product will incorporate all of these ( , charging, , ).But the revolution is already rolling, as more and more people enjoy the benefits and share their experiences with friends and family, coworkers, and employers.

Currently, less than 10% of the world's energy consumption is carbon-free electricity. Combined with massive eletrification of most activities, we will still rely on fossil derived electricity in the near future. We must therefore also limit the electricity consumption of our transportation systems. This shift necessitates vehicles dedicated to each usage and, for urban use, lightweight, lower-speed design that significantly reduces energy consumption compared to heavy electric cars. However, the ownership model involves individuals purchasing a single, all-encompassing vehicle to meet diverse needs and to fulfill a broad range of requirements such as speed, distance, cargo space, safety, and seating capacity.To change from today cars to optimized vehicles, we must transition from vehicle ownership to ‚ÄúMobility as a Service‚Äù. In this model, people will not own cars but will access the right vehicle for specific needs. This has the potential of dramatically enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, improving experience and allocating urban space more equitably among modes of transportation.When vehicles cannot self-navigate, ensuring the availability of the right shared vehicle at the right time and place is impossible, discouraging car owners from giving up ownership. Shared vehicles, in this context, mostly serve as alternatives to public transport or bicycles, averaging 3 to 4 trips a day. This fails to deliver substantial cost, space, or emission benefits compared to ownership.To facilitate a paradigm shift, shared vehicles must possess level 4 self-driving capabilities, allowing them to reach users when and where they're needed in given areas. Autonomous shared vehicles can operate significantly more frequently, akin to taxis, averaging around 20 trips a day as already current experiments have demonstrated. This dramatic increase in utilization holds the potential for substitution of around 5 cars and a substantial reduction in the number of vehicles on the road.The advantages of this transformation are evident: reduced pollution, lower travel costs, and decreased road congestion. Autonomous vehicles also offer enhanced safety and road infrastructure utilization, efficient driving modes and enable multimodal combinations, creating exciting new mobility experiences.We should not limit self-driving capability to existing modes of transportation such as taxis or busses but reimagine mobility based on people's needs to reduce energy consumption and optimize urban space.Implications on regulations, urban planning and the way players need to rethink their current operating mode and business model are huge. Self-driving capability represents the crucial missing link in our quest to zero carbon mobility and more livable cities.We need to start this journey now.Read the full article below.\", \"Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are three interconnected fields that play a significant role in the world of technology and data-driven decision-making.

Impressed to see that these operators are now ready to shift from testing and piloting to commercially scaling their technologies. The enormous investments of AV start-ups are clearly visible in the San Francisco streets. We were extremely lucky to see and experience ourselves these disruptive ride-hailing services, without a safety driver inside the vehicle.

I am convinced that this technology will sooner than later disrupt our urban mobility making it much more safe, efficient, user friendly, environment friendly and affordable for everyone. We had meetings with several government regulators giving us an insight on the complex permit journey and the challenges they still see. It was quite surprising to see how the relatively few AV collisions were making daily the news in San Francisco, while the safety potential is so high compared to human drivers. In our meetings with several government regulators, we received a much better understanding in both underregulating and overregulation AV innovation. The real success of this study trip was bringing together several Belgian stakeholders including federal and regional authorities and public transport operators to see, feel and experience AV. Also in Belgium, structured dialogues with public and private stakeholders will be key to introduce the next level of AV in our country, understanding the positive impact of AV but also to anticipate on unwanted effects like the substitution of public transport or an unwanted uptake of vehicle-kms.

The rapid evolution of ADAS and self-driving vehicles is steering in a new era of software-defined vehicles.In this highly competitive automotive landscape, the pursuit of cutting-edge trends, such as highly automated driving and full automation, is pushing the boundaries of current engineering capabilities.Just five or six years ago, a new vehicle would typically be equipped with around 60 to 100 sensors. However, the automotive landscape has transformed significantly since then, with today\\'s vehicles showing a staggering 200 or more onboard sensors.This evolution in sensor quantity and technology is closely aligned with the increasing intelligence and autonomy of vehicles. As automotive engineering propels forward, these sensors continue to advance in sophistication and will undoubtedly multiply as new features become commonplace.This surge in sensor capabilities has sparked innovation across all faces of vehicle design. It\\'s reshaping the vehicle\\'s E/E architecture, while intensifying the complexity of automotive software. The current 100 million lines of code found in vehicles are projected to expand to 300+ million lines by 2030. To put this into perspective, consider that, fueled by data from all sensors, a single car can generate anywhere from 1.4 to 19 Terabytes of data per hour, translating to roughly 380 to 5,100 Terabytes annually.This exponential surge in data generation underscores the urgent necessity for the industry to develop robust strategies to effectively manage and navigate the intricate landscape of this growing code complexity.The future of automotive software is upon us, and it promises not only smarter and more autonomous vehicles but also a profound transformation in how we approach vehicle engineering and design.

However, pandemic-related shocks to the automobile sector, a move toward investing in electric vehicles, and the utter complexity of the technology have all contributed to the autonomous-driving revolution stalling. For now, we have several types of autonomous driving. Though, some of them still do request driver‚Äôs involvement in specific situations.Mercedes-Benz has won worldwide clearance for its \"level three\" autonomous driving system in compliance with United Nations regulations, putting it ahead of the competition.Hands-free level three provides autonomous driving in some scenarios, such as heavy traffic or highway speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour (37 miles per hour). Drivers may take their sights off the road, but they must be prepared to take action if necessary.However, the great majority of today\\'s commercially accessible automobiles have just \"level two\" partial automation. This includes Tesla\\'s well-known \"autopilot\" which provides features like as adaptive cruise control and automated parking ‚Äì all while the driver maintains full control.Finally, \"level four\" cars, such as Waymo or Cruise\\'s robot autos, may function without ant human involvement within defined zones.There is an assumption that autonomous vehicles will eventually be such a significant improvement over human-driven cars ‚Äî providing safer, cheaper, more efficient transportation that can replace car ownership ‚Äî that we should allow companies to experiment and tolerate some disruption. And it is quite fair, this technology has a lot of promise for safer driving without human factor.However, there is no certainty that self-driving cars will solve all transportation issues. It\\'s highly possible that self-driving vehicles would worsen traffic jams by repeatedly looping blocks between passengers.Companies that give autonomous car experiences, on the other hand, have received tremendous hostility, not only from citizens of various cities, but also from government officials and law enforcement. People have voiced fear that robot cars will harm jobs or undermine attempts to reduce general car ownership. ', \"Tesla is the most valuable car manufacturer, with a market cap of over üí≤850B.

The next article, How to Collapse any ODD into a Tractable and Solvable model will be published in Autonomous Vehicle International soon. The short version has been edited and is ready for release, the longer version is 60 pages and will be made available for download. Nondeterministic models require a comparative memory of correctness in order to sort out correct/incorrect and safe/unsafe newly made relationships. They also need to know that the vehicle can fit between and pass and stop at a safe distance. The HARA, as approached by 7FM will provide a useful comparative memory for such use as well a better lesson plan. Driving and figuring out why a human steers and brakes avoids the need to figure out how to write the code. It produces an erratic driver that does not know safe from unsafe. Self-learning models only learn AFTER a crash, or it is observed performing a wrong decision. This is the make-test-fix design process, and it will NEVER produce a safe design.Autonomy can perform correct/incorrect throttle, braking, and steering. Safety means that autonomy knows WHY the commands are safe.This is the evidence required to ship autonomy to an OEM truck/vehicle manufacturer.', \"As we see EVs starting to flip from early adopter (myself in 2017) to mass market adoption so much has already changed. $40K was the minimum cost of an EV, and now it is $27K. 50kW maximum charging is now beyond 300kW for passenger EVs turning the FASTEST charging time from 1 hour to 10 minutes (, , ).Some vehicles have solar (, , ) , Some vehicles have bidirectional charging (, )Some vehicles have wireless charging ()Some vehicles have driving computers with adaptive cruise control and lane correction and pedestrian braking (, ) and even blockchain mining ().A truly revolutionary product will incorporate all of these ( , charging, , ).But the revolution is already rolling, as more and more people enjoy the benefits and share their experiences with friends and family, coworkers, and employers.

Currently, less than 10% of the world's energy consumption is carbon-free electricity. Combined with massive eletrification of most activities, we will still rely on fossil derived electricity in the near future. We must therefore also limit the electricity consumption of our transportation systems. This shift necessitates vehicles dedicated to each usage and, for urban use, lightweight, lower-speed design that significantly reduces energy consumption compared to heavy electric cars. However, the ownership model involves individuals purchasing a single, all-encompassing vehicle to meet diverse needs and to fulfill a broad range of requirements such as speed, distance, cargo space, safety, and seating capacity.To change from today cars to optimized vehicles, we must transition from vehicle ownership to ‚ÄúMobility as a Service‚Äù. In this model, people will not own cars but will access the right vehicle for specific needs. This has the potential of dramatically enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, improving experience and allocating urban space more equitably among modes of transportation.When vehicles cannot self-navigate, ensuring the availability of the right shared vehicle at the right time and place is impossible, discouraging car owners from giving up ownership. Shared vehicles, in this context, mostly serve as alternatives to public transport or bicycles, averaging 3 to 4 trips a day. This fails to deliver substantial cost, space, or emission benefits compared to ownership.To facilitate a paradigm shift, shared vehicles must possess level 4 self-driving capabilities, allowing them to reach users when and where they're needed in given areas. Autonomous shared vehicles can operate significantly more frequently, akin to taxis, averaging around 20 trips a day as already current experiments have demonstrated. This dramatic increase in utilization holds the potential for substitution of around 5 cars and a substantial reduction in the number of vehicles on the road.The advantages of this transformation are evident: reduced pollution, lower travel costs, and decreased road congestion. Autonomous vehicles also offer enhanced safety and road infrastructure utilization, efficient driving modes and enable multimodal combinations, creating exciting new mobility experiences.We should not limit self-driving capability to existing modes of transportation such as taxis or busses but reimagine mobility based on people's needs to reduce energy consumption and optimize urban space.Implications on regulations, urban planning and the way players need to rethink their current operating mode and business model are huge. Self-driving capability represents the crucial missing link in our quest to zero carbon mobility and more livable cities.We need to start this journey now.Read the full article below.\", \"Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are three interconnected fields that play a significant role in the world of technology and data-driven decision-making.

As he recently did for a group of Belgian transportation planners who had come to San Francisco to learn about the future of transportation.We meet regularly to exchange ideas about trends in Silicon Valley. On Thursday, Mario had come to Capitola and proposed to demonstrate to me the progress of \"full self driving\" at Tesla. I had once ridden with an acquaintance about a year ago and didn\\'t have too good memories about the system.We chose only a short and not very demanding route - from Capitola to my house in Aptos. The progress was indeed remarkable. But the disadvantages also became apparent. Because the Tesla was driving very defensively, a driver demonstratively took the right of way from us at the Four Way intersection. The Tesla took the curvy road to my house very fast and almost knocked over a garbage can. Not excusable, however, was that we almost clipped a couple on a crosswalk in Capitola if Mario hadn\\'t slammed on the brakes hard.Elon Musk claims that the upcoming version 12 would be much better. To be fair, the short drive was remarkable. Mario claims that he has driven through San Francisco during rush hour with almost no interventions.But my skepticism about whether Musk can actually pull off autonomous driving using only cameras was only reinforced by this ride.

The rapid evolution of ADAS and self-driving vehicles is steering in a new era of software-defined vehicles.In this highly competitive automotive landscape, the pursuit of cutting-edge trends, such as highly automated driving and full automation, is pushing the boundaries of current engineering capabilities.Just five or six years ago, a new vehicle would typically be equipped with around 60 to 100 sensors. However, the automotive landscape has transformed significantly since then, with today\\'s vehicles showing a staggering 200 or more onboard sensors.This evolution in sensor quantity and technology is closely aligned with the increasing intelligence and autonomy of vehicles. As automotive engineering propels forward, these sensors continue to advance in sophistication and will undoubtedly multiply as new features become commonplace.This surge in sensor capabilities has sparked innovation across all faces of vehicle design. It\\'s reshaping the vehicle\\'s E/E architecture, while intensifying the complexity of automotive software. The current 100 million lines of code found in vehicles are projected to expand to 300+ million lines by 2030. To put this into perspective, consider that, fueled by data from all sensors, a single car can generate anywhere from 1.4 to 19 Terabytes of data per hour, translating to roughly 380 to 5,100 Terabytes annually.This exponential surge in data generation underscores the urgent necessity for the industry to develop robust strategies to effectively manage and navigate the intricate landscape of this growing code complexity.The future of automotive software is upon us, and it promises not only smarter and more autonomous vehicles but also a profound transformation in how we approach vehicle engineering and design.

I expect to see more pilot programs and autonomous ride-share services hitting the streets this, and specially next year. This could transform how we commute and travel within cities in the near future.Also, one of the primary promises of self-driving technology is improved road safety. Self-driving systems are becoming more sophisticated and better at avoiding accidents every day, getting closer to the goal of almost no-accidents.But, what would happen if the AI in the car needs to chose between the saftely of the car occupants and the pedestrians?Governments and regulatory bodies are working to establish guidelines and rules for self-driving vehicles. In 2024, we can expect to see more standardized regulations but there are many ethical questions to solve like the one I just posted above.Another important factor I would like to remark is connectivity, because self-driving cars are not just about autonomy; they are also about connectivity, with other vehicles (V2V) and also vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I). The communication and shared data between them will help avoiding accidents but also reducing traffic congestion, for instance.Autonomous vehicle testing is ramping up and major automakers, tech companies, and startups are conducting extensive trials to fine-tune their self-driving systems, not only in passenger vehicles but also in long-haul trucks and public transportation.The race to lead in self-driving technology continues to be fierce. Companies from various countries are competing to develop the most advanced autonomous systems and prove their capabilities to reduce traffic congestion and improve fuel efficiency through optimized driving patterns.While self-driving technology is really promising, the level 5 of car full-driving autonomy is still to be reached.In the meantime, keep an eye on the road and drive safely, because the roads are still crowded with ineficient drivers nervious to reach destination ;0    ', 'At #ANCongress this week, Chris Urmson ‚Äî one of the founding members of Google‚Äôs self-driving car project and now the CEO and co-founder of Aurora Innovation ‚Äî said the company‚Äôs self-driving technology is expected to be ‚Äúfeature complete,‚Äù next year.

However, pandemic-related shocks to the automobile sector, a move toward investing in electric vehicles, and the utter complexity of the technology have all contributed to the autonomous-driving revolution stalling. For now, we have several types of autonomous driving. Though, some of them still do request driver‚Äôs involvement in specific situations.Mercedes-Benz has won worldwide clearance for its \"level three\" autonomous driving system in compliance with United Nations regulations, putting it ahead of the competition.Hands-free level three provides autonomous driving in some scenarios, such as heavy traffic or highway speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour (37 miles per hour). Drivers may take their sights off the road, but they must be prepared to take action if necessary.However, the great majority of today\\'s commercially accessible automobiles have just \"level two\" partial automation. This includes Tesla\\'s well-known \"autopilot\" which provides features like as adaptive cruise control and automated parking ‚Äì all while the driver maintains full control.Finally, \"level four\" cars, such as Waymo or Cruise\\'s robot autos, may function without ant human involvement within defined zones.There is an assumption that autonomous vehicles will eventually be such a significant improvement over human-driven cars ‚Äî providing safer, cheaper, more efficient transportation that can replace car ownership ‚Äî that we should allow companies to experiment and tolerate some disruption. And it is quite fair, this technology has a lot of promise for safer driving without human factor.However, there is no certainty that self-driving cars will solve all transportation issues. It\\'s highly possible that self-driving vehicles would worsen traffic jams by repeatedly looping blocks between passengers.Companies that give autonomous car experiences, on the other hand, have received tremendous hostility, not only from citizens of various cities, but also from government officials and law enforcement.

Currently, less than 10% of the world's energy consumption is carbon-free electricity. Combined with massive eletrification of most activities, we will still rely on fossil derived electricity in the near future. We must therefore also limit the electricity consumption of our transportation systems. This shift necessitates vehicles dedicated to each usage and, for urban use, lightweight, lower-speed design that significantly reduces energy consumption compared to heavy electric cars. However, the ownership model involves individuals purchasing a single, all-encompassing vehicle to meet diverse needs and to fulfill a broad range of requirements such as speed, distance, cargo space, safety, and seating capacity.To change from today cars to optimized vehicles, we must transition from vehicle ownership to ‚ÄúMobility as a Service‚Äù. In this model, people will not own cars but will access the right vehicle for specific needs. This has the potential of dramatically enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, improving experience and allocating urban space more equitably among modes of transportation.When vehicles cannot self-navigate, ensuring the availability of the right shared vehicle at the right time and place is impossible, discouraging car owners from giving up ownership. Shared vehicles, in this context, mostly serve as alternatives to public transport or bicycles, averaging 3 to 4 trips a day. This fails to deliver substantial cost, space, or emission benefits compared to ownership.To facilitate a paradigm shift, shared vehicles must possess level 4 self-driving capabilities, allowing them to reach users when and where they're needed in given areas. Autonomous shared vehicles can operate significantly more frequently, akin to taxis, averaging around 20 trips a day as already current experiments have demonstrated. This dramatic increase in utilization holds the potential for substitution of around 5 cars and a substantial reduction in the number of vehicles on the road.The advantages of this transformation are evident: reduced pollution, lower travel costs, and decreased road congestion. Autonomous vehicles also offer enhanced safety and road infrastructure utilization, efficient driving modes and enable multimodal combinations, creating exciting new mobility experiences.We should not limit self-driving capability to existing modes of transportation such as taxis or busses but reimagine mobility based on people's needs to reduce energy consumption and optimize urban space.Implications on regulations, urban planning and the way players need to rethink their current operating mode and business model are huge. Self-driving capability represents the crucial missing link in our quest to zero carbon mobility and more livable cities.We need to start this journey now.Read the full article below.\", \"Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are three interconnected fields that play a significant role in the world of technology and data-driven decision-making.

After many years of development and (restricted) testing, and not more than 10 days ago, California regulators have given the green light to Cruise (General Motors) and Waymo (Google) to offer commercial robotaxi services 24 hours a day, seven days a week, across the city. Impressed to see that these operators are now ready to shift from testing and piloting to commercially scaling their technologies. The enormous investments of AV start-ups are clearly visible in the San Francisco streets. We were extremely lucky to see and experience ourselves these disruptive ride-hailing services, without a safety driver inside the vehicle. I was really impressed by the level of comfort and safety in all circumstances (day, night, traffic jams, complex traffic situations, ‚Ä¶). Yes, autonomous vehicles are coming. I am convinced that this technology will sooner than later disrupt our urban mobility making it much more safe, efficient, user friendly, environment friendly and affordable for everyone. We had meetings with several government regulators giving us an insight on the complex permit journey and the challenges they still see. It was quite surprising to see how the relatively few AV collisions were making daily the news in San Francisco, while the safety potential is so high compared to human drivers. In our meetings with several government regulators, we received a much better understanding in both underregulating and overregulation AV innovation. The real success of this study trip was bringing together several Belgian stakeholders including federal and regional authorities and public transport operators to see, feel and experience AV. Also in Belgium, structured dialogues with public and private stakeholders will be key to introduce the next level of AV in our country, understanding the positive impact of AV but also to anticipate on unwanted effects like the substitution of public transport or an unwanted uptake of vehicle-kms. The real success of this study trip was by bringing together many Belgian stakeholders active in the mobility ecosystem exploring and experiencing the potential of AV and reflecting on next steps in Belgium.

The rapid evolution of ADAS and self-driving vehicles is steering in a new era of software-defined vehicles.In this highly competitive automotive landscape, the pursuit of cutting-edge trends, such as highly automated driving and full automation, is pushing the boundaries of current engineering capabilities.Just five or six years ago, a new vehicle would typically be equipped with around 60 to 100 sensors. However, the automotive landscape has transformed significantly since then, with today\\'s vehicles showing a staggering 200 or more onboard sensors.This evolution in sensor quantity and technology is closely aligned with the increasing intelligence and autonomy of vehicles. As automotive engineering propels forward, these sensors continue to advance in sophistication and will undoubtedly multiply as new features become commonplace.This surge in sensor capabilities has sparked innovation across all faces of vehicle design. It\\'s reshaping the vehicle\\'s E/E architecture, while intensifying the complexity of automotive software. The current 100 million lines of code found in vehicles are projected to expand to 300+ million lines by 2030. To put this into perspective, consider that, fueled by data from all sensors, a single car can generate anywhere from 1.4 to 19 Terabytes of data per hour, translating to roughly 380 to 5,100 Terabytes annually.This exponential surge in data generation underscores the urgent necessity for the industry to develop robust strategies to effectively manage and navigate the intricate landscape of this growing code complexity.The future of automotive software is upon us, and it promises not only smarter and more autonomous vehicles but also a profound transformation in how we approach vehicle engineering and design.

However, pandemic-related shocks to the automobile sector, a move toward investing in electric vehicles, and the utter complexity of the technology have all contributed to the autonomous-driving revolution stalling. For now, we have several types of autonomous driving. Though, some of them still do request driver‚Äôs involvement in specific situations.Mercedes-Benz has won worldwide clearance for its \"level three\" autonomous driving system in compliance with United Nations regulations, putting it ahead of the competition.Hands-free level three provides autonomous driving in some scenarios, such as heavy traffic or highway speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour (37 miles per hour). Drivers may take their sights off the road, but they must be prepared to take action if necessary.However, the great majority of today\\'s commercially accessible automobiles have just \"level two\" partial automation. This includes Tesla\\'s well-known \"autopilot\" which provides features like as adaptive cruise control and automated parking ‚Äì all while the driver maintains full control.Finally, \"level four\" cars, such as Waymo or Cruise\\'s robot autos, may function without ant human involvement within defined zones.There is an assumption that autonomous vehicles will eventually be such a significant improvement over human-driven cars ‚Äî providing safer, cheaper, more efficient transportation that can replace car ownership ‚Äî that we should allow companies to experiment and tolerate some disruption. And it is quite fair, this technology has a lot of promise for safer driving without human factor.However, there is no certainty that self-driving cars will solve all transportation issues. It\\'s highly possible that self-driving vehicles would worsen traffic jams by repeatedly looping blocks between passengers.Companies that give autonomous car experiences, on the other hand, have received tremendous hostility, not only from citizens of various cities, but also from government officials and law enforcement. People have voiced fear that robot cars will harm jobs or undermine attempts to reduce general car ownership. ', \"Tesla is the most valuable car manufacturer, with a market cap of over üí≤850B.

By contrast, cruise control is level one, and the European Commission is yet to approve level three, which would still leave the driver in ultimate control of the vehicle. So it is early days.But for the time being, that may be enough. Even Ewing still enjoys driving the old fashioned way.\"On a quiet cross country journey, I love to drive the car myself,\" he said.Ewing points out that 90% of road traffic accidents are a result of human error, and fully-automated systems are predicted to make driving safer and much more efficient.\"Once cars are able to drive without any human intervention at all, there will also be significant time savings as people are freed up from their hours currently spent at the wheel,\" he said.Do you use self-driving car technology?

The next article, How to Collapse any ODD into a Tractable and Solvable model will be published in Autonomous Vehicle International soon. The short version has been edited and is ready for release, the longer version is 60 pages and will be made available for download. Nondeterministic models require a comparative memory of correctness in order to sort out correct/incorrect and safe/unsafe newly made relationships. They also need to know that the vehicle can fit between and pass and stop at a safe distance. The HARA, as approached by 7FM will provide a useful comparative memory for such use as well a better lesson plan. Driving and figuring out why a human steers and brakes avoids the need to figure out how to write the code. It produces an erratic driver that does not know safe from unsafe. Self-learning models only learn AFTER a crash, or it is observed performing a wrong decision. This is the make-test-fix design process, and it will NEVER produce a safe design.Autonomy can perform correct/incorrect throttle, braking, and steering. Safety means that autonomy knows WHY the commands are safe.This is the evidence required to ship autonomy to an OEM truck/vehicle manufacturer.', \"As we see EVs starting to flip from early adopter (myself in 2017) to mass market adoption so much has already changed. $40K was the minimum cost of an EV, and now it is $27K. 50kW maximum charging is now beyond 300kW for passenger EVs turning the FASTEST charging time from 1 hour to 10 minutes (, , ).Some vehicles have solar (, , ) , Some vehicles have bidirectional charging (, )Some vehicles have wireless charging ()Some vehicles have driving computers with adaptive cruise control and lane correction and pedestrian braking (, ) and even blockchain mining ().A truly revolutionary product will incorporate all of these ( , charging, , ).But the revolution is already rolling, as more and more people enjoy the benefits and share their experiences with friends and family, coworkers, and employers.

Currently, less than 10% of the world's energy consumption is carbon-free electricity. Combined with massive eletrification of most activities, we will still rely on fossil derived electricity in the near future. We must therefore also limit the electricity consumption of our transportation systems. This shift necessitates vehicles dedicated to each usage and, for urban use, lightweight, lower-speed design that significantly reduces energy consumption compared to heavy electric cars. However, the ownership model involves individuals purchasing a single, all-encompassing vehicle to meet diverse needs and to fulfill a broad range of requirements such as speed, distance, cargo space, safety, and seating capacity.To change from today cars to optimized vehicles, we must transition from vehicle ownership to ‚ÄúMobility as a Service‚Äù. In this model, people will not own cars but will access the right vehicle for specific needs. This has the potential of dramatically enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, improving experience and allocating urban space more equitably among modes of transportation.When vehicles cannot self-navigate, ensuring the availability of the right shared vehicle at the right time and place is impossible, discouraging car owners from giving up ownership. Shared vehicles, in this context, mostly serve as alternatives to public transport or bicycles, averaging 3 to 4 trips a day. This fails to deliver substantial cost, space, or emission benefits compared to ownership.To facilitate a paradigm shift, shared vehicles must possess level 4 self-driving capabilities, allowing them to reach users when and where they're needed in given areas. Autonomous shared vehicles can operate significantly more frequently, akin to taxis, averaging around 20 trips a day as already current experiments have demonstrated. This dramatic increase in utilization holds the potential for substitution of around 5 cars and a substantial reduction in the number of vehicles on the road.The advantages of this transformation are evident: reduced pollution, lower travel costs, and decreased road congestion. Autonomous vehicles also offer enhanced safety and road infrastructure utilization, efficient driving modes and enable multimodal combinations, creating exciting new mobility experiences.We should not limit self-driving capability to existing modes of transportation such as taxis or busses but reimagine mobility based on people's needs to reduce energy consumption and optimize urban space.Implications on regulations, urban planning and the way players need to rethink their current operating mode and business model are huge. Self-driving capability represents the crucial missing link in our quest to zero carbon mobility and more livable cities.We need to start this journey now.Read the full article below.\", \"Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are three interconnected fields that play a significant role in the world of technology and data-driven decision-making.

An extensive validation of the safety case by an independent team of experts showed that even without a steward, the shuttles are at least as safe as a shuttle with a human driver.We are extremely proud that the hard work and support of many people and organisations has managed to achieve this unique milestone.

After many years of development and (restricted) testing, and not more than 10 days ago, California regulators have given the green light to Cruise (General Motors) and Waymo (Google) to offer commercial robotaxi services 24 hours a day, seven days a week, across the city. Impressed to see that these operators are now ready to shift from testing and piloting to commercially scaling their technologies. The enormous investments of AV start-ups are clearly visible in the San Francisco streets. We were extremely lucky to see and experience ourselves these disruptive ride-hailing services, without a safety driver inside the vehicle. I was really impressed by the level of comfort and safety in all circumstances (day, night, traffic jams, complex traffic situations, ‚Ä¶). Yes, autonomous vehicles are coming. I am convinced that this technology will sooner than later disrupt our urban mobility making it much more safe, efficient, user friendly, environment friendly and affordable for everyone. We had meetings with several government regulators giving us an insight on the complex permit journey and the challenges they still see. It was quite surprising to see how the relatively few AV collisions were making daily the news in San Francisco, while the safety potential is so high compared to human drivers. In our meetings with several government regulators, we received a much better understanding in both underregulating and overregulation AV innovation. The real success of this study trip was bringing together several Belgian stakeholders including federal and regional authorities and public transport operators to see, feel and experience AV. Also in Belgium, structured dialogues with public and private stakeholders will be key to introduce the next level of AV in our country, understanding the positive impact of AV but also to anticipate on unwanted effects like the substitution of public transport or an unwanted uptake of vehicle-kms. The real success of this study trip was by bringing together many Belgian stakeholders active in the mobility ecosystem exploring and experiencing the potential of AV and reflecting on next steps in Belgium.

The rapid evolution of ADAS and self-driving vehicles is steering in a new era of software-defined vehicles.In this highly competitive automotive landscape, the pursuit of cutting-edge trends, such as highly automated driving and full automation, is pushing the boundaries of current engineering capabilities.Just five or six years ago, a new vehicle would typically be equipped with around 60 to 100 sensors. However, the automotive landscape has transformed significantly since then, with today\\'s vehicles showing a staggering 200 or more onboard sensors.This evolution in sensor quantity and technology is closely aligned with the increasing intelligence and autonomy of vehicles. As automotive engineering propels forward, these sensors continue to advance in sophistication and will undoubtedly multiply as new features become commonplace.This surge in sensor capabilities has sparked innovation across all faces of vehicle design. It\\'s reshaping the vehicle\\'s E/E architecture, while intensifying the complexity of automotive software. The current 100 million lines of code found in vehicles are projected to expand to 300+ million lines by 2030. To put this into perspective, consider that, fueled by data from all sensors, a single car can generate anywhere from 1.4 to 19 Terabytes of data per hour, translating to roughly 380 to 5,100 Terabytes annually.This exponential surge in data generation underscores the urgent necessity for the industry to develop robust strategies to effectively manage and navigate the intricate landscape of this growing code complexity.The future of automotive software is upon us, and it promises not only smarter and more autonomous vehicles but also a profound transformation in how we approach vehicle engineering and design.

The next article, How to Collapse any ODD into a Tractable and Solvable model will be published in Autonomous Vehicle International soon. The short version has been edited and is ready for release, the longer version is 60 pages and will be made available for download. Nondeterministic models require a comparative memory of correctness in order to sort out correct/incorrect and safe/unsafe newly made relationships. They also need to know that the vehicle can fit between and pass and stop at a safe distance. The HARA, as approached by 7FM will provide a useful comparative memory for such use as well a better lesson plan. Driving and figuring out why a human steers and brakes avoids the need to figure out how to write the code. It produces an erratic driver that does not know safe from unsafe. Self-learning models only learn AFTER a crash, or it is observed performing a wrong decision. This is the make-test-fix design process, and it will NEVER produce a safe design.Autonomy can perform correct/incorrect throttle, braking, and steering. Safety means that autonomy knows WHY the commands are safe.This is the evidence required to ship autonomy to an OEM truck/vehicle manufacturer.', \"As we see EVs starting to flip from early adopter (myself in 2017) to mass market adoption so much has already changed. $40K was the minimum cost of an EV, and now it is $27K. 50kW maximum charging is now beyond 300kW for passenger EVs turning the FASTEST charging time from 1 hour to 10 minutes (, , ).Some vehicles have solar (, , ) , Some vehicles have bidirectional charging (, )Some vehicles have wireless charging ()Some vehicles have driving computers with adaptive cruise control and lane correction and pedestrian braking (, ) and even blockchain mining ().A truly revolutionary product will incorporate all of these ( , charging, , ).But the revolution is already rolling, as more and more people enjoy the benefits and share their experiences with friends and family, coworkers, and employers.

Currently, less than 10% of the world's energy consumption is carbon-free electricity. Combined with massive eletrification of most activities, we will still rely on fossil derived electricity in the near future. We must therefore also limit the electricity consumption of our transportation systems. This shift necessitates vehicles dedicated to each usage and, for urban use, lightweight, lower-speed design that significantly reduces energy consumption compared to heavy electric cars. However, the ownership model involves individuals purchasing a single, all-encompassing vehicle to meet diverse needs and to fulfill a broad range of requirements such as speed, distance, cargo space, safety, and seating capacity.To change from today cars to optimized vehicles, we must transition from vehicle ownership to ‚ÄúMobility as a Service‚Äù. In this model, people will not own cars but will access the right vehicle for specific needs. This has the potential of dramatically enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, improving experience and allocating urban space more equitably among modes of transportation.When vehicles cannot self-navigate, ensuring the availability of the right shared vehicle at the right time and place is impossible, discouraging car owners from giving up ownership. Shared vehicles, in this context, mostly serve as alternatives to public transport or bicycles, averaging 3 to 4 trips a day. This fails to deliver substantial cost, space, or emission benefits compared to ownership.To facilitate a paradigm shift, shared vehicles must possess level 4 self-driving capabilities, allowing them to reach users when and where they're needed in given areas. Autonomous shared vehicles can operate significantly more frequently, akin to taxis, averaging around 20 trips a day as already current experiments have demonstrated. This dramatic increase in utilization holds the potential for substitution of around 5 cars and a substantial reduction in the number of vehicles on the road.The advantages of this transformation are evident: reduced pollution, lower travel costs, and decreased road congestion. Autonomous vehicles also offer enhanced safety and road infrastructure utilization, efficient driving modes and enable multimodal combinations, creating exciting new mobility experiences.We should not limit self-driving capability to existing modes of transportation such as taxis or busses but reimagine mobility based on people's needs to reduce energy consumption and optimize urban space.Implications on regulations, urban planning and the way players need to rethink their current operating mode and business model are huge. Self-driving capability represents the crucial missing link in our quest to zero carbon mobility and more livable cities.We need to start this journey now.Read the full article below.\", \"Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are three interconnected fields that play a significant role in the world of technology and data-driven decision-making.
